Requires the Director, if an agency has not established procedures for the transfer of training technology, to negotiate the transfer of such technology upon application by such user.

Authorizes the Director to waive, or negotiate reductions of, such purchase prices or other favorable terms for commercial users who agree to enter into cooperative agreements with public interest users or user groups. Requires such agreements to be acceptable to the Director and to provide for a conversion of the training technology, without charge, by the commercial user to meet the specific needs of the public interest user or user group. Requires the Director, in negotiating such terms for the sale or lease of training technology, to give preferential consideration to cooperative agreements which: (1) will result in enhancing the employment potential and potential earnings of the maximum number of individuals; (2) encourage and promote multiple uses of training technology converted by users with similar training needs; and (3) provide beneficial uses of training technology for small businesses. Requires any training technology converted under such a cooperative agreement to be: (1) listed in the inventory; and (2) available for transfer to any other public interest user. Requires the Director to: (1) study the effectiveness of training technology transfers and conversions under this title; and (2) analyze national needs for methods to convert training technology which are in addition to the method of cooperative agreements between commercial and public interest users. Requires the Director, within three years after the enactment of this title, to report to the Congress on such study and analysis, with the Director's recommendations as to whether the public interest would be served through the establishment of a program of grants to support the conversion of training technology. Requires all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Director in implementing this title.
