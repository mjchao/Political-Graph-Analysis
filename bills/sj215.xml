  <summary>11/10/1987--Introduced.
Authorizes the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project, Inc., to establish a statue of a woman Vietnam veteran within the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to honor and recognize the women of the U.S. armed forces who served in the Vietnam war. Expresses the sense of the Congress that after the addition of such statue, no further additions to the site should be authorized or undertaken. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to select a site for the statue within the Memorial. Makes the design proposal subject to the approval of the Secretary and the National Capital Planning Commission. Prohibits the United States or the District of Columbia from paying any expense of establishing the statue. Provides that authorization for the statue shall lapse unless: (1) the establishment of such statue is commenced within five years of the date of approval of this resolution; and (2) the Secretary certifies that sufficient funds to complete the statue are available prior to groundbreaking. Makes the Secretary responsible for the statue's maintenance and care. Exempts the Secretary from the requirement of seeking the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts in implementing this resolution.</summary>
