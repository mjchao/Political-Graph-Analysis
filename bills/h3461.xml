  <summary>10/9/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require the court to permit the defendant (or the defendant's attorney) and the attorney for the Government 30 minutes each to examine prospective jurors. (Current law leaves it to the court's discretion whether to permit such examination). Allows the court to: (1) grant additional time; (2) supplement the examination with its own inquiry; and (3) limit the questions allowed during the examination. Sets forth time requirements for juror examination in the case of multiple defendants.</summary>
