  <summary>3/29/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful for any person to manufacture, assemble, import, sell, possess, receive, ship, or deliver any firearm which is not: (1) as detectable as the Minimum Security Standard Exemplar, after the removal of grips, stocks, and magazines, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated and operated in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards for use at U.S. airports; or (2) impregnated with barium sulfate, or a similar compound, to facilitate detectability by cabinet x-ray systems. States that nothing in this Act shall require: (1) the FAA to utilize the Minimum Security Standard Exemplar as a FAA detection standard; or (2) that a firearm be made of any particular material or be of any particular weight as long as the detectability standard is met. States that firearms manufactured before the date of enactment of this Act, and the frame or receiver of any firearm, shall be excluded from coverage under this Act. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing the importation of undetectable firearms. Provides increased criminal penalties for using or carrying an undetectable firearm during the commission of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Defines the term "Minimum Security Standard Exemplar" to mean a firearm substitute used for testing that resembles a revolver, is made of material type 17-4 PH stainless, and weighs four ounces. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to conduct research to improve the effectiveness of airport security metal detectors and airport security x-ray systems. Directs the Administrator of the FAA, the Director of the Secret Service, and the Director of the Marshals Service to conduct a study to identify available equipment capable of detecting the Minimum Security Standard Exemplar while distinguishing innocuous metal objects. Allows the Secretary, when appropriate because of changed technology, to submit proposed legislation to amend the definition of Minimum Security Standard Exemplar.</summary>
