  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to declare ineffective any termination dates which appear in certificates authorizing airlines to engage in foreign air transportation. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) review an airline's certification to provide foreign air transportation; and (2) replace such airline's certification with that of another applicant which has demonstrated it will provide a substantially improved combination of service and rates. Prescribes conditions under which the Secretary may exercise this authority.</summary>
