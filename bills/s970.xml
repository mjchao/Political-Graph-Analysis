  <summary>7/29/1987--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Alternative Agricultural Products Research Act of 1987 - States that the purpose of this Act is to authorize research in plant and plant material modification in order to develop new (nonfood and nonfiber) marketable industrial and commercial products. Establishes in the Department of Agriculture the New Products Research Board to be administered by the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Science and Education. States that the Board shall advise the Assistant Secretary with respect to research project selection and evaluation. Sets forth project selection criteria, including: (1) the prospect of developing viable modification technologies; (2) the need and potential market for the new product; (3) the reduction in Federal agricultural subsidies; (4) the ability to grow the needed plant; and (5) the unavailability of other funding sources. Gives funding priority (at least one-half of total funds) to biotechnological research projects. States that projects shall be: (1) conducted by a project group unless the Secretary of Agriculture finds that a particular project is more appropriate for a single research entity; and (2) funded for periods of at least three years or until a marketable product is developed or determined to be unobtainable or unnecessary. Directs the Secretary to initially fund at least 20 projects within the first 36 months after enactment of this Act. Requires project group reports to the Board, and Board reports to the Secretary. Authorizes FY 1988 through 2007 appropriations.</summary>
