  <summary>3/25/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the United States should place greater emphasis on the improvement of U.S. conventional forces, particularly in cooperation with other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and (2) such improvement should emphasize improved readiness and greater sustainability in conflict; defensive measures, particularly joint development and deployment of infantry antitank weapons; and the assumption that the United States would not be the first to use nuclear weapons.</summary>
