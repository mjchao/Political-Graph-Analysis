  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
National Voluntary Health Insurance Act of 1987 - Creates a National Voluntary Health Insurance Agency (Agency) to operate a National Voluntary Health Insurance Plan (Plan) with funds supplied by voluntary subscriptions and matching Treasury funds. Describes the administrative composition of the Agency, whose Director will be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. States that the Agency shall issue no rules or regulations, but shall be governed solely by this Act and its amendments. Authorizes appropriations. Withholds funding for duplicative benefits currently provided as hospital and medical service insurance benefits or payments by other Government agencies, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Enumerates Plan benefits to include: (1) medical services when provided by a licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine or medical doctor and wherever furnished, including psychiatric medicine, surgery, obstetrics, radiological and electrical procedures, pathology tests, transfusions, medication and immunization, injections, and anesthesia; (2) reconstructive oral surgery; (3) podiatric surgery; (4) laboratory services; and (5) inpatient or outpatient hospital services, supplies, medication, transfusions, and food provided by approved hospitals, including general or special hospitals, outpatient clinics, emergency wards, convalescent hospitals, nursing homes, and acute alcohol or drug toxification treatment centers. Excludes from coverage: (1) cosmetic surgery not approved under this Act; (2) certain services that are not medically necessary; (3) services for the benefit of a second party other than the enrollee; (4) certain employer responsibilities, such as those of a workers' compensation insurer; (5) services already covered by another plan; (6) hospital or laboratory services provided by an unapproved facility; and (7) certain other medical advice and services. Sets the amount of premium payments at $40 per month for each adult and $20 for each child. Entitles subscribers with a total annual family income of less than $12,000 to have their premiums calculated on a percentage-of-income basis, to a minimum monthly premium of five dollars per adult. Provides for the payment of premiums by employers and for the reinstatement of coverage on account of unpaid premiums paid within 60 days of the due date. Requires the Agency to establish a trust fund for the deposit of all premiums and at least an equal amount of money appropriated from the Treasury. Directs the Congress to deposit in such fund the amount of $5,000,000,000 by the effective date of the Plan. Declares that the total amount of general funds appropriated to the fund shall not exceed the total amount of subscribers' premiums after the Plan's fifth year of operation. Reserves 35 percent of the total amount of subscribers' premiums deposited in the trust fund for the payment of medical and laboratory service benefits, 62 percent of such premiums for hospital service benefits, and three percent for administrative costs. Applies a parallel apportionment scheme to trust fund monies derived from Treasury general funds. Sets forth enrollment and reimbursement provisions. Allows participating providers to require an enrollee to pay a reasonable charge in addition to the Plan fee. Sets forth standards and procedures governing Plan participation by medical service providers, laboratories, and hospitals. Directs the Agency to: (1) set a fee for every professionally recognized diagnostic and therapeutic medical service and for all laboratory pathological tests; and (2) provide each approved hospital with a schedule or per diem rate and charges that it will pay. Requires that the medical and laboratory services fees be in proportion to the usual, customary, and reasonable fees for such services and that the hospital charges be based on each hospital's certified annual financial and operating cost statement. Specifies certain additional requirements with respect to hospital charges. Requires Agency consultation with appropriate medical professional society personnel in the setting and revision of schedules and fees. Sets forth requirements with respect to the auditing, payment, and assessment on claims and the utilization of Plan benefits. Authorizes the Agency to temporarily or permanently exclude any enrollee or provider for making fraudulent payment or service claims. Mandates that the Agency directors, within a specified time period, consider the advisability and feasibility of offering additional Plan benefits and that they bring their recommendations before the Congress for appropriate amendment of this Act. Permits Plan subscribers to receive Plan benefits within the context of a prepaid group medical practice or Health Maintenance Organization. Provides for premium increases or changes in trust fund allocations in the event Plan costs exceed trust fund reserves. Requires the Congress, at the time this Act becomes operational, to amend the rates of Social Security taxes relative to the reduction in Social Security health insurance expenditures effected by this Act. Requires that all malpractice claims be resolved by arbitration, and sets forth procedures to govern such arbitration, including provision for appeals to the appropriate State or Federal court. Declares that the resources of the Agency and of the Plan shall not be used in any way directly to regulate the quality or availability of, or to establish or operate, medical and hospital services. Details the estimated cost of the Plan for FY 1987.</summary>
