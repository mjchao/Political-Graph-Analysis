  <summary>4/9/1987--Introduced.
Older Americans Act Amendments of 1987 - Title I: Amendments to Title II: Administration on Aging - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 (the Act) to require that at least five of the 15 members of the Federal Council on the Aging be older individuals. (Currently, at least two members must be older individuals.) Provides that after FY 1987 appointments to the Council shall be made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes appropriations for the Council for FY 1988 through 1990. Title II: Amendments to Title III: Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988, through 1990 for supportive services, senior centers, and congregate and home delivered nutrition services for the aged. Bases a State's share of appropriated funds on the proportion of individuals aged 65 or older in the United States which reside in such State. (Currently, the allotment formula is based on individuals aged 60 or older.) Eliminates the guarantee that a State's allotment will be no less than its allotment for FY 1984. Prohibits the Federal share of costs of a State's long-term care ombudsman program from exceeding 85 percent. Authorizes a State agency to function as an area agency on aging for the entire State or a portion of the State. Clarifies the inclusion of factors which put an individual at risk of institutionalization within the definition of "greatest social need." Eliminates the requirement that an area agency on aging expend some of its funds for support services on legal assistance and in-home and access services to require only that some funds be expended on one or more of those services. Makes the Davis-Bacon Act inapplicable to contracts for the construction, alteration, or renovation of multipurpose senior centers which are not in excess of $100,000. Requires States to provide assurances that area agencies on aging will facilitate the coordination of community-based services to older individuals residing at home, or in hospitals or long term care facilities, who are at risk of institutionalization but could remain in or be returned to the community if community-based services were available. Authorizes States to permit area agencies on aging to change fees, based on ability to pay, for supportive services, provided that no low-income individuals are charged for such services. Authorizes the Commissioner on Aging to waive certain requirements of the Older Americans Act in the case of Statewide demonstration projects relating to the initiation, expansion, or improvement of supportive or nutrition services for the aged. Repeals the authority of States to apply to the Commissioner for funds, in addition to funds which have been allotted to them, for State plan administration. Increases the portion of allotments that States may transfer between the supportive services and nutrition services programs from 30 percent under current law to 50 percent for FY 1988, 60 percent for FY 1989, and 75 percent for FY 1990. Repeals the requirement that a State's allotment for any fiscal year be reduced by the percentage by which its expenditures from State sources for that fiscal year are less than such expenditures for the preceding fiscal year. Title III: Amendments to Title IV: Training, Research, and Discretionary Projects and Programs - Deletes specific descriptions of the types of education and training programs for which the Commissioner may make grants and enter into contracts. Repeals a provision of the Act specifically authorizing the Commissioner to make grants for establishing or supporting gerontology centers. (Authority to fund such centers would still be available under the Commissioner's general authority.) Gives the Commissioner general authority to make grants to and enter into contracts with: (1) any public or private entity or individual for research and development, evaluation, collection, and dissemination of information, and conducting of conferences relating to title IV of the Act; and (2) any public or private agency or organization in the State for nationwide, Statewide, or local demonstration project providing supportive or nutrition services or otherwise promoting the well-being of older individuals. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988, through 1990 for programs under title IV of the Act. Repeals the prohibition on the transfer of title IV funds to any office or other authority of the Federal Government not directly responsible to the Commissioner. Title IV: (Omitted) Title V: Amendments to Title VI: Grants for Indian Tribes - Eliminates the requirement that individuals served by a tribal organization receiving grants under title VI of the Act not receive support and nutrition services under title III of the Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988, through 1990 for grants to Indian tribes. Title VI: Repeal of Title VII: Older American Personal Health Education and Training Program - Repeals the Older Americans Personal Health Education and Training Program under title VII of the Act. Title VII: Minor and Technical Amendments - Sets forth technical amendments.</summary>
