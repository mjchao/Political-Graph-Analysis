  <summary>7/28/1987--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to conduct a study of the proper minimum altitude which should be maintained by aircraft flying over areas within units of the National Park System. Directs the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Federal Aviation Administration, to provide technical assistance to the Secretary of the Interior for such study. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress, within three years after enactment of this Act, regarding the study results. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to: (1) review, on the basis of aviation safety, current regulations pertaining to aircraft flights over units of the National Park System addressed in the study conducted by the Secretary of the Interior or other units as needed or requested; and (2) report to the Congress the results of such review together with recommendations for changes. Authorizes appropriations for such studies. Prohibits any fixed wing aircraft or helicopter from flying below specified minimum altitudes, during such study and review periods, over the surfaces of Yosemite National Park and Haleakala National Park, except as specified. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit recommendations for air traffic management and noise abatement over Grand Canyon National Park to the Administrator, including flight free zones and allowing transport to specified Indian lands. Requires the Administrator to prepare and issue a final plan for the management of such air space. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Congress whether such final plan has succeeded in substantially restoring the natural quiet in the Grand Canyon National Park. Exempts certain helicopter flights of river runners from prohibition under the noise abatement plan. Requires the Administrator to survey aircraft flights over the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Minnesota, and to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the type and frequency of aircraft using such airspace. Directs the Chief of the Forest Service to assess and report to the Congress within two years any adverse impacts to wilderness resources from overflights of National Forest System wilderness areas. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
