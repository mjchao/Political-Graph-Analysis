  <summary>3/4/1988--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Foreign Relations with amendment (without written report)) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) President Delvalle of Panama has the full support of the American people and should receive the support of the U.S. Government, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations in his effort to assert civilian authority and restore democracy to Panama; (2) the U.S. Government should formally terminate all contacts with General Noriega, should consider imposing economic sanctions if General Noriega continues to defy President Delvalle's order to step down as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, and should put together an aid package for Panama in the event that progress toward democracy is achieved; and (3) the President should study the impact of a shutdown of the trans-Panama pipeline on the energy supplies and national security of the United States and the economy of Panama.</summary>
