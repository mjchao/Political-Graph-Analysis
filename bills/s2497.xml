  <summary>6/10/1988--Introduced.
Amends Federal mining law pertaining to unpatented mining claims to reserve in the United States the right to manage and dispose of the mineral material in land subject to such claims. (Current law reserves only the right to vegetative surface resources.) Entitles the claim holder to mineral material, free of charge, from the nearest federally-administered mineral material site if such material is needed by the claim holder for mining operations after the United States has disposed of mineral material from the claim site.</summary>
