(Measure passed House, amended) Title I: Criminal Law and Procedure Minor Substantive and Technical Amendments Act of 1987 - Criminal Law and Procedure Minor Substantive and Technical Amendments Act of 1987 - Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Federal criminal code. Provides increased criminal penalties where a bodily injury results during the commission of the crime of deprivation of rights under color of law. Grants the Associate Attorney General authority to: (1) approve certain civil rights prosecutions; (2) approve prosecutions for flight to avoid service of process; (3) summon special grand juries; (4) request a judicial grant of immunity; and (5) object to the disclosure of classified information under the Classified Information Procedures Act. Grants specially designated Assistant Attorneys General authority to approve certain civil rights prosecutions. Grants the Deputy Assistant Attorneys General authority to request judicial grants of immunity. Permits the transmission of information on sports betting from a State where such betting is legal to a foreign country where such betting is legal. Permits prosecutions for certain obstruction of justice offenses: (1) to be brought in the district where the official proceeding was intended to be effected or in the district in which the conduct constituting the alleged offense occurred; and (2) where the culpable conduct is "corrupt persuasion." Amends the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to raise the maximum prison term for class B felonies from 20 to 25 years. Amends the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 to establish conditions for the temporary release (furlough) of persons hospitalized following an acquittal by reason of insanity. Requires copies of certain periodic reports prepared by directors of psychiatric hospitals concerning persons hospitalized for threatening the President, the Vice President, or certain other persons protected by the Secret Service, to be submitted to the Director of the U.S. Secret Service. Authorizes governmental access to records concerning electronic communication service or remote computing service through the issuance of a trial subpoena. (Current law provides for such access only through the issuance of an administrative or grand jury subpoena.) Extends the power to conduct certain psychiatric and psychological examinations under the Federal criminal code to all psychologists. (Current law extends such power to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.) Title II: Rules Enabling Act of 1987 - Rules Enabling Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal judicial code with respect to the U.S. Supreme Court's power to prescribe Federal rules of civil procedure (including bankruptcy rules). Empowers the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of evidence. (Currently, it only has power to prescribe amendments to such rules which are promulgated by the Congress.) Authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to appoint committees comprised of judges and attorneys who will recommend the rules to be prescribed for Federal practice, procedure, and evidence. Mandates the appointment of a standing committee on rules of practice, procedure, and evidence to review all committee recommendations for consistency. Requires all committee meetings, with specified exceptions, to be open to the public and to be preceded by sufficient public notice to enable all interested persons to attend. Requires that recommendations or prescriptions for rules of practice and procedure be accompanied by: (1) a proposed rule; (2) an explanatory note on the rule; and (3) a written explanation of the recommending body's action including minority or separate views. Requires the Supreme Court to transmit proposed rules of civil practice, procedure, and evidence to the Congress by May 1 of the year in which such rules are to become effective. Sets December 1 of such year as the effective date for such rules. Authorizes the Supreme Court to determine the extent such rules shall apply to proceedings then pending, except that the Supreme Court shall not require the application of such rule to further proceedings then pending to the extent that, in the opinion of the court in which such proceedings are pending, the application of such rule in such proceedings would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former rule applies. Requires the Conference periodically to compile rules and orders with regard to procedures dealing with judicial discipline. Requires the Conference periodically to review the procedural rules for consistency with the Conference's rules of practice, procedure, and evidence. Authorizes the Conference to modify or abrogate inconsistent rules. Provides that rules prescribed by district courts for the conduct of their business must require public notice and opportunity for comment before they are made or amended. Requires each judicial council periodically to review certain district court rules for consistency with those rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Authorizes each council to modify or abrogate any rule found to be inconsistent. Provides that all orders by the judicial councils relating to practice and procedure shall be made after public notice and an opportunity for comment. Amends the Federal criminal code to rescind the power of the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of criminal practice and procedure for: (1) trials held by magistrates; and (2) taking and hearing appeals to district court judges from magistrate-held trials.</summary>
