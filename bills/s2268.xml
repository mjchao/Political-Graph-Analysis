  <summary>4/11/1988--Introduced.
Burial Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 - Amends Federal law relating to burial allowances for veterans to authorize plot allowances only to veterans who are either eligible for a burial allowance or who were discharged from active duty due to a service-connected disability. (Currently, a veteran of any war, whether or not disabled, is eligible for such plot allowance.) Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to reimburse a veteran for the cost of a prepurchased headstone (in lieu of furnishing such a headstone at burial). Extends through FY 1993 the authorization of appropriations for the making of grants to States for the establishment, expansion, and improvement of veterans' cemeteries. Removes the maximum per-State grant limitation available for such grants.</summary>
