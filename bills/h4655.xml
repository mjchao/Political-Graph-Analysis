Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts for evaluation of the models demonstrated and for dissemination of the information developed. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to nurse training entities: (1) to demonstrate innovative nursing practice models for services in the home and in long-term care facilities designed to increase recruitment and retention of nurses and improve nursing care; and (2) to develop projects to increase the exposure of nursing students to clinical practice in nursing home, home health, and gerontologic settings. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts for evaluation of the projects developed and for dissemination of the information developed. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for the identification of specific community nursing needs and the development and establishment of programs of educational outreach and nurse recruitment. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to nurse training schools for scholarships for nursing students in need. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Title II: Special Projects - Revises the description of nursing education special projects eligible for certain grants and contracts with regard to: (1) inclusion of the promotion of occupational health care as a purpose; (2) the priorities in training and education to upgrade the skills of paraprofessional nursing personnel; (3) development of curricula for certain nursing baccalaureate situations; (4) facilitation of the completion of advanced nurse education programs by certain specialists; and (5) provision of nursing education courses to rural areas through telecommunications via satellite.
