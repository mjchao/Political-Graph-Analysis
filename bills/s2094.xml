  <summary>2/25/1988--Introduced.
Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to exclude parental income and resources from the determination of a disabled child's SSI eligibility if such child requires the level of care provided in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility, but care outside such a facility is appropriate and less costly. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a 50 percent excise tax on gain or other income realized by greenmail (amounts paid by corporations in redeeming their stock from certain shareholders) recipients.</summary>
