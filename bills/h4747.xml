  <summary>6/3/1988--Introduced.
Designates specified lands in the Los Padres National Forest, California, as the Sespe, Matilija, and San Rafael Wilderness Areas, which shall be components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Provides for the administration of such areas by the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with the Wilderness Act of 1964. Authorizes the Secretary to take necessary actions for fire prevention and watershed protection in such areas and for the management of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. Requires maps and descriptions of each wilderness area to be filed with specified congressional committees and to be made available for public inspection. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study of the Johnston Ridge Trail located on the Ojai Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest, for purposes of ascertaining the appropriate management of the trail in relation to other portions of the District. Specifies that such study shall consider the environmental impacts of mechanized vehicles and shall require preparation of an environmental assessment. Requires the study to be completed within two years after enactment of this Act and submitted to specified congressional committees. Declares that, pending completion of such study and a final management determination, it is the intent of the Congress that the trail shall remain open to off-highway vehicle use.</summary>
