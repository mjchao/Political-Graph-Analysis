  <summary>1/28/1987--Introduced.
Ocean Mineral Resources Development Act - Prohibits any Federal agency from offering for lease for exploration, development, or production of polymetallic sulfide or other hard rock minerals under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or any other Federal law any of the area off the Pacific Coast known as the Gorda Ridge, until the President has submitted a Gorda Ridge feasibility report to the Congress and the Congress has lifted such prohibition, or until after September 30, 1991, whichever occurs earlier. Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation with any other U.S. agencies having responsibilities for research and other scientific studies relating to the Gorda Ridge area, to prepare and submit to the Congress, no later than one year after the enactment of this Act, a memorandum of understanding clarifying the respective responsibilities of each U.S. department or agency with respect to such research and studies and with respect to the President's Gorda Ridge report. Directs the President to prepare and submit to the Congress, no later than September 30, 1990, a Gorda Ridge feasibility report. Requires such report to include specified information and studies relating to the Gorda Ridge and recommendations as to the most appropriate leasing procedures and lease values for exploratory and production activities there.</summary>
