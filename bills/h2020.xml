  <summary>10/22/1988--Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment.
(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Title I: - Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to require the Council on Environmental Quality to report annually to the Congress on Federal agency reviews submitted to it on the implementation and effectiveness of measures specified in environmental impact statements for the mitigation of the adverse impact on fish and wildlife populations and habitat. Amends the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970 to authorize appropriations for FY 1987 through 1989 for the operations of the Office of Environmental Quality and the Council on Environmental Quality. Authorizes States to petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, within 60 days of this Act's enactment, for reconsideration of the retroactive application of its order waiving certain hydroelectric project certification requirements to any proposed hydroelectric project in the State for which a license application was pending as of February 11, 1987 and is still pending. Reinstates a petitioning State's certification or denial of a hydroelectric project if such certification or denial was waived by retroactive application of such order. Title III: Waste Reduction (Sic) - Pollution Prevention Act of 1988 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an office within the EPA which will be independent of the EPA's single-medium program offices and have the authority to review and advise such offices on their activities to promote a multi-media approach to source reduction. Directs the Administrator to develop and implement a strategy to promote source reduction. Identifies several review, coordination, outreach, and organizational actions that the Administrator must take as part of such strategy. Requires the Administrator to: (1) make matching grants to States for programs promoting the use of source reduction techniques by businesses; and (2) establish a Source Reduction Clearinghouse to compile information generated by States receiving grants on management, technical, and operational approaches to source reduction. Requires that such information be made available to the public. Directs facilities releasing a high quantity of toxic chemicals to include in their filings of annual toxic chemical release forms, required under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, toxic chemical source reduction and recycyling reports for toxic chemicals which are the subject of such filings. Includes in such reports information, on a facility-by-facility basis, as to: (1) the amounts and disposition of each toxic chemical; (2) the source reduction practices used with respect to such chemicals; (3) measurements of changes from past to anticipated levels of chemical reduction and recycling; and (4) the techniques used to identify source reduction opportunities. Makes such information available to the public. Requires the Administrator to survey such facilities to gauge changes in the volume of waste due to source reduction, recycling, and treatment. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress on data collected from such reports and surveys in 1989 and 1990. Authorizes appropriations. Repeals this title on July 1, 1991. Title IV: Commemoration of Statehood Anniversaries - Statehood Centennial Commemorative Coin Act of 1989 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue not more than a specified number of five dollar palladium coins in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the statehood of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Sets forth certain features of such coins and provides for their design, issuance, and sale. Terminates authority to mint coins under this Act after December 31, 1990. Requires a specified amount of all surcharges received from the sale of the coins to be provided to the "Documents West" exhibition program and administered by the Idaho Centennial Foundation, to be used only for promoting the exhibition. Requires the Secretary to deposit in the Treasury all remaining surcharges received, to be used to reduce the national debt. Declares that: (1) no law governing procurement or public contracts shall be applicable to the procurement of goods and services for this Act, except laws relating to equal employment opportunity; and (2) no firm shall be considered a Federal contractor for purposes of specified Federal regulations as a result of participating as a U.S. Mint coin consignee.</summary>
