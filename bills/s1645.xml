(Reported to Senate from the Select Committee on Indian Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 100-233) Title I: Indian Education - Indian Education Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Education Amendments of 1978 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the operation or the facilities of any Bureau of Indian Affairs funded school operated on or after April 1, 1987, or any program of such a school operated on or after April 1, 1987, only if: (1) the tribal governing body approves such transfer; or (2) the Secretary complies with the requirements for school closures. Prohibits the Secretary from closing, consolidating, or substantially curtailing a Bureau funded boarding school for failure to meet the national criteria for dormitory situations during any fiscal year for which the Secretary has not submitted the annual plan for boarding schools. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress, within six months after a temporary closure, consolidation, or curtailment of a Bureau school is initiated because of an immediate hazard to health and safety, a report stating the reasons for such temporary actions and the Secretary's actions to eliminate the hazard if the Secretary estimates the closure will exceed one year. Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the determination of eligibility for schools to become Bureau funded schools and for Bureau fund schools to expand their programs so as to receive increased funding. Requires that the eligibility determinations be based on geographic and demographic factors and the history and record of success or failure of: (1) the proposed school or the school proposing to expand; and (2) the public schools or other alternative providers of the services which the school proposes to provide with the Bureau's financial assistance. Provides that if the school board of the Bureau funded schools at the Pueblo of Zia and the Tama Settlement vote within two years of the enactment of this Act to expand the schools to include kindergarten through grade eight, they shall be so expanded. Provides that the dormitory criteria may be waived in the same manner as the minimum academic standards. Requires the Secretary, before publishing in the Federal Register any regulation or rule relating to Indian education, to: (1) submit the regulation or rule to regulatory review panels; and (2) take into account the panels' comments and advice. Requires the Secretary to establish, for each area office of the Bureau where a Bureau-funded school is located, regulatory review panels. Authorizes the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register the initial notice of a temporary regulation or rule without submitting it to the review panels, if: (1) an emergency exists; and (2) such regulation or rule is needed within a limited period of time. Requires the Secretary, for FY 1989 and each subsequent fiscal year, to adjust the formula for determining the minimum annual amount of funds for each Bureau-funded school to: (1) use specified weighted units for each eligible Indian student that vary according to grades, whether a student is handicapped, and whether a student is gifted and talented; (2) consider a school with an average daily attendance of less than 50 eligible Indian students as having 50 eligible Indian students for implementing the adjustment factor for small school: (3) take into account the provision of residential services on a less than nine-month basis; and (4) provide additional funding to schools that are required to meet State standards which exceed minimum accreditation standards. Requires the Secretary to provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school to pay the indirect and administrative costs of such schools in order to: (1) enable tribes and tribal organizations to provide all related administrative overhead services and operations needed to meet the requirements of law and prudent management; and (2) carry out other necessary support functions. Provides that the amount of the grant provided to each tribe or tribal organization shall be determined by applying the administrative cost percentage rate of the tribe or tribal organization to each direct cost program for which funds are received from or through the Bureau.

Extends the policy for Indian control of Indian education to both the Bureau and the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to consult with Indian tribes and tribal organizations in developing policy under the Education Amendments of 1978. Requires the Secretary to conduct regional, semi-annual meetings with Indian tribes and tribal organizations to consult with them on Indian education. Requires the Secretary to: (1) keep Indian tribes and tribal organizations informed of all plans and activities of the Bureau which affect, or relate to, Bureau contract schools that serve the particular Indian tribe or tribal organization; and (2) invite active participation of the Indian tribe or tribal organization in making decisions about such schools and programs. Requires the Secretary, when considering construction or expansion of any school and proposals to the Congress for the closure, consolidation, curtailment, or transfer of any school or dormitory, to consult from the initial stages with affected groups of Indians. Permits a tribal organization to waive Indian employment preference laws with respect to applicants for educational personnel positions. Amends the definition of "education position" to include a position at a Bureau school involving support services. Provides that such definitional change shall apply to a Bureau employee only at the election of that employee. Directs the Secretary, by March 1, 1988, to submit to the Congress a report comparing personnel compensation in Bureau schools with: (1) educationally successful public schools in the same State that are comparable in size, geographic location, grade levels, and student population; and (2) schools operated in the United States by the Department of Defense. Requires such report to include: (1) current salaries and personnel benefits for comparable positions; (2) a comparison of starting salaries, tenure, length of service, educational requirements, length of work year, and fringe benefits; and (3) a projection of compensation figures for such schools for the next five years. Requires the rates of basic compensation for educators and education positions at Bureau schools to be comparably to the rates for comparable qualified individuals holding comparable positions in public schools serving comparable students in comparable areas. Requires the Secretary, upon the request of the local school board, to authorize a school supervisor to provide post differentials unless the disparity in compensation between Bureau school and public schools does not meet a specified level. Authorizes the Secretary or the supervisor of a school to discontinue or decrease a post differential if: (1) the local school board requests such action; or (2) the Secretary or the supervisor determines no disparity affecting recruitment or retention exists. Requires the Secretary, by February 1 of each year, to submit a report to the Congress describing requests and grants of authority for post differentials.

Directs the Secretary to grant a tribe's application for the transfer of the operation of a school to the tribe and for grant eligibility, unless the Secretary finds that the services to be provided by the tribe will be deleterious to the welfare of the Indians served by the school.
