  <summary>10/1/1987--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Extends until November 15, 1987, the following Federal provisions relating to the Veterans Administration (VA) housing loan guaranty program: (1) the collection from participating veterans of the VA housing loan fee; and (2) the formula for determining whether, upon foreclosure, the VA shall acquire the property securing a guaranteed loan. Revises restrictions on the sale by the VA Administration of notes of security loans financing the purchase of real property acquired by the Administrator as a result of a default on a VA loan. Allows such sale: (1) with recourse (i.e., creating direct liability on the part of the note purchaser for the full value of the note's remaining amount); or (2) without recourse, as long as the amount received is equal to the unpaid balance of such loan.</summary>
