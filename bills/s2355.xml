Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 for the following: (1) procurement by the defense agencies; (2) the chemical demilitarization program; and (3) procurement by the Reserves and National Guard. Authorizes the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, under specified limitations and conditions, to enter into multiyear contracts for the procurement of certain weapons and defense systems. Part B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from selecting a second source for production of a certain assembled package for 155 millimeter M864 ammunition until the program enters full-rate production and the Secretary reports to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees (the defense committees) on an acquisition plan for the establishment of a second source for the program. Places certain requirements, restrictions, or limitations on the following Navy procurement programs: (1) the Trident II Missile program; (2) the DDG-51 Destroyer program; (3) the 5-Inch Semi-Active Laser Guided Projectile program; (4) AH-1W Ground Support Equipment; and (5) AN/SQR-17A Acoustic Processors. Earmarks specified funds for: (1) the procurement of one DDG-51 class destroyer; and (2) certain electronic warfare equipment. Prohibits FY 1989 Air Force funds from being obligated or expended in connection with the launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Part C: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Defense, no later than December 1, 1988, to submit to the Congress a detailed report on the current and projected requirements of the Navy for aircraft. Extends through April 30, 1997, the deadline for completion of the chemical demilitarization program (the destruction of lethal chemical weapons) under the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1986. Directs the Secretary to notify the Senate and House Armed Services Committees (the defense committees) of any delays in meeting such deadline. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Part A: Funding Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 to the armed forces and the defense agencies for research, development, test, and evaluation. Part B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - Repeals a specified provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 which limited the funds authorized to be obligated for the AAWS-Medium (anti-tank weapon system) until the Secretary of the Army completed evaluation of the MILAN II anti-armor weapon system. Prohibits funds from being used for procurement or for research, development, test, or evaluation of the MILAN II or the Bofors BILL medium anti-tank system. Earmarks specified funds for the Navy Trident II missile. Disallows any general defense program reductions to be taken from such program. Prohibits the Secretary of the Navy, during FY 1989, from carrying out an electromagnetic pulse program in the Chesapeake Bay area in connection with the Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment Simulator Program for Ships (EMPRESS). Earmarks specified funds for the making of a grant to the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences in connection with a program of research relating to manufacturing technology. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of developing a common launch control system for the MX rail garrison program and the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) program. Directs the Secretary to proceed with such a system if it is found to be feasible and cost-effective. Directs the Secretary, through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, to conduct a review of the small ICBM program, requiring certain estimates as part of such review. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the potential vulnerability of a small ICBM system to special operations forces of a potential enemy or to domestic saboteurs. Directs the Secretary to submit the results of such studies, together with comments and recommendations, to the defense committees and the Senate and House Appropriations Committees no later than March 1, 1989. Earmarks funds for such studies and the Small ICBM and MX rail garrison programs. Earmarks specified funds for the following defense agency programs: (1) an Optoelectronics Materials Center; (2) the Consolidated Department of Defense (DOD) Software Initiatives program; and (3) extended air defenses (tactical missile systems). States the focus of the Balanced Technology Initiative program (BTI) to be the development of innovative concepts and methods of enhancing conventional defense capabilities, including the development of concepts and methods which will accelerate the rate of obsolescence of equipment, doctrine, and tactics of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries. States particular initiatives, programs, and weapons to be given emphasis under BTI. Earmarks specified funds for this program as well as for BTI programs authorized under prior defense authorization Acts. Requires the Director of Defense Research and Engineering to determine the amount of funds appropriated to the armed forces and the defense agencies for BTI. States that the Conventional Defense Initiative is not an element of BTI. Prohibits required defense budget reductions from being taken from BTI funds. Prohibits such earmarked funds from being used in connection with the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program. Requires the Director, within 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to report to the defense and appropriations committees of the Congress on the implementation of these BTI provisions. Prohibits any funds from being obligated for BTI programs until such report has been received, and 30 days have elapsed since the receipt of such report. Limits the obligation of funds for advanced tactical aircraft within the Navy and Air Force until the Secretary has made certain certifications to the Congress concerning sufficient budgeting for demonstration and validation programs in connection with such aircraft. Limits the obligation of funding for combat identification systems until the Secretary has made certain certifications to the Congress relating to sufficient funding for specified parts and programs within such combat identification system. Limits funding for specified air-to-air missile programs unless the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force establish joint program offices for the co-development of such programs. Limits the authorization of appropriations for specified defense programs. Directs the Secretary to reduce such authorized amount to achieve a total reduction of $10,000,000. Earmarks specified funds for the purchase of high-technology manufacturing equipment and the installation of such equipment in a private, nonprofit center for advanced technologies for the purpose of training, in a production facility, machine tool operators in skills critical to the defense technology base. Outlines requirements necessary before the obligation of such funding, including a congressional notice-and-wait period. Prohibits funding during FY 1989 for the BIGEYE binary chemical bomb until the Comptroller General makes certain certifications to the Congress relating to the testing, design, and production of such weapon. Earmarks specified research and development funds for product evaluation activity conducted by DOD. Part C: Strategic Defense Initiative - States the total amount to be obligated for the SDI program, stating specific amounts for each subsystem within SDI. States that funds appropriated to DOD may not be used to establish a Strategic Defense System Operational Test and Evaluation activity. Directs the Secretary, no later than 90 days after 1989 funding for SDI is enacted by legislation, to submit to the defense and appropriations committees of the Congress a report on the allocation of SDI funding for FY 1989. Prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise made available to DOD for FY 1989 from being obligated or expended: (1) for any development or testing of anti-ballistic missile systems, with a specified exception; or (2) for the acquisition of any material or equipment required to be used for the development or testing of anti-ballistic missile systems or components, with a specified exception. States that such limitation does not apply to certain SDI funds for FY 1989. Part D: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary, no later than December 31, 1988, to submit to the defense committees a report on the plans and projected expenditures for the Long-Range Conventional Cruise Missile program. States certain findings of the Senate with regard to strategic missile modernization. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the authorization of funds in this Act for research and development in connection with the Small ICBM and the MX Rail Garrison does not constitute a commitment or express an intent by the Senate to provide funds to procure and deploy the Midgetman missile or to deploy any MX missiles in a rail-mobile basing mode or both. Authorizes the Secretary of a military department, unless the quantity of a material in the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) is lower than the required amount, to loan to a foreign government supplies, materials, or equipment for the purpose of carrying out a program of cooperative research, development, testing, or evaluation. Authorizes the Secretary to accept as a loan or a gift such materials, supplies, or equipment for such purpose. Permits the materials, supplies, or equipment loaned to a foreign government under this provision to be consumed if the Secretary concerned: (1) determines that the success of the research or development depends on the consumption of such item; and (2) approves of the expenditure or consumption of such materials, supplies, or equipment. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 to require an annual report concerning the designation of major non-NATO allies only when a country or countries have been added to or deleted from such list.
