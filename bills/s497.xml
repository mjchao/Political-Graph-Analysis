  <summary>2/5/1987--Introduced.
Fair Trade and Economic Justice Act - Declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) promote an open and fair international trading system; (2) strengthen international trading rules to renounce the exploitation of workers in order to gain a competitive advantage in international trade; and (3) treat as an unfair trade practice any competitive advantage derived from denial of worker rights. Title I: Negotiating Objectives Regarding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Enforcement of Internationally Recognized Worker Rights - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include among the actions to be taken on trade agreements the enhancement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) through: (1) the adoption of an additional GATT article declaring that the exploitation of workers is an unjustifiable means for a country to gain a competitive trade advantage; (2) the amendment of the GATT to affirm such principle; or (3) the adoption and implementation of a code of internationally recognized worker rights. Prohibits the President from entering into any negotiation with respect to any trade agreement unless the President first reports to specified congressional committees on the actions that will be taken to protect workers' rights and to redress the trade disadvantage of countries that rely primarily on direct taxes for revenue needs. Prohibits any trade agreement entered into after enactment of this Act from taking effect with respect to the United States unless the President consults with specified congressional committees on the progress being made to protect workers' rights. Title II: Enforcement of United States Rights under Trade Agreements and Response to Certain Foreign Practices - Authorizes the President, in response to certain unfair foreign trade practices, to deny nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to imports from a country that engages in such practices. Adds to the definition of "unreasonable" trade acts, policies, or practices: (1) toleration of cartels; and (2) denial of internationally recognized worker rights. Requires petitioners for relief from unfair trade practices, as well as persons who request hearings in unfair trade practice cases, to have substantial evidence. (Currently any interested person may petition for relief and may request a hearing in such cases.) Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to submit recommendations to the President within nine months of the start of an investigation into unfair trade practices if the petition alleges that the unfair trade practice involves denial of internationally recognized workers' rights.</summary>
