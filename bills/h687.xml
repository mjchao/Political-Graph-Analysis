Civilian Conservation Corps II Act - Establishes the Civilian Conservation Corps II. Makes the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) responsible for administration and oversight of the Corps. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study to determine a practical basis for evaluating applications for Corps camps; (2) establish procedures and machinery for Corps administration; and (3) coordinate and encourage interagency action with respect to the Corps. Requires that Corps work projects be consistent with the mission or function of each participating land managing agency (Federal, State, local, or tribal government agencies responsible for any public or Indian lands or waters, recreation areas, or historical sites or buildings). Sets forth examples of such projects. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to assure that such work projects are consistent with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and other prescribed standards. Limits membership in the Corps to individuals who, at the time of enrollment, are: (1) unemployed; (2) 16 through 25 years of age; and (3) U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, or lawfully admitted refugees or parolees. Requires that applicants under 19 years of age give adequate assurances that they did not leave school for the express purpose of enrolling. Makes selection of Corps members the responsibility of the chief administrator of each participating land managing agency. Requires that selections be from among qualified persons who have: (1) applied directly to the land managing agency; (2) been referred directly by a State employment security service or by a sponsor of an Indian program or of a migrant or seasonal farmworker program; or (3) been listed on a master referral list maintained by the Secretary according to specified guidelines. Requires that membership selection preference be given to minority youths and to youths residing in rural or urban areas having substantial youth unemployment. Limits the period of Corps enrollment for any member to 24 months, which may be served either continuously or in two or three shorter terms. Permits members to complete a continuous term after attaining age 26. Prohibits enrollment solely for school vacation periods. Sets forth provisions for the establishment of residential and nonresidential Corps camps, including provisions for Corps camp management. Provides that Corps members and crew leaders shall be deemed Federal employees only for purposes of: (1) the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., social security and unemployment); (2) title II of the Social Security Act (Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Benefits); (3) Federal employees workers' compensation; and (4) Government liability in tort claims. Permits Corps members to volunteer to enlist in armed forces reserves or in National Guards, except that periods of active duty shall not be considered as time served in the Corps. Amends the Military Selective Service Act to exempt persons who have completed a two-year enrollment in the Corps from induction for training and service, except during the period of a war or a national emergency. Sets forth requirements for applications for establishment of Corps camp projects and procedures for project selection. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or enter into agreements for the funding and operation of Corps camps with Federal, State, or local agencies or tribal organizations which certify that specified requirements shall be met. Directs the Secretary to give selection preference to projects which: (1) can be planned and initiated promptly; (2) will be labor-intensive; (3) will provide meaningful work experience to the Corps members involved; and (4) will provide long-term benefits to the public. Directs the Secretary to try to ensure an equitable distribution of projects among the States based on relative populations of youth of eligible ages. Directs the Secretary to dispense or expend at least 50 percent of the sums appropriated to carry out this Act pursuant to agreements with State, local, or Indian land managing agencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish standards for specified pay rates for Corps members and crew leaders and reasonable hours and conditions of employment; (2) provide for the collection and sale of biomass recovered by Corps camp projects; and (3) arrange, with the assistance of the Secretary of Education, for academic credit awards for Corps experience and for academic study by Corps members. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and the Congress on the activities carried out under this Act. Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions.
