  <summary>4/26/1988--Introduced.
Afghan Peace and Reconstruction Resolution - Urges the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees to immediately develop a plan to assist the Afghans on their return to their homeland. Calls upon: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State to urge multilateral development banks and international organizations to contribute $300,000,000 over five years for the relief, reconstruction, and economic recovery of Afghanistan; and (2) the Secretary of State to urge certain nations to make a combined contribution of $450,000,000 for such purposes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. assistance to the Afghan resistance should not be cut off until the President is confident that all Soviet troops have been withdrawn from Afghanistan and that Soviet assistance to the current Afghan Government has ceased. Expresses the sense of the Congress that if the President determines that all such Soviet military assistance has been terminated, U.S. military support for the resistance is no longer necessary, and an acceptable government is in power, the President should request that the Congress provide $250,000,000 in assistance over five years for the relief, reconstruction, and economic recovery of Afghanistan.</summary>
