  <summary>10/19/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a National Voluntary Reunion Registry within the Department of Health and Human Services under the direction of the Secretary's designee. Provides that the Registry shall facilitate, on a voluntary mutual request basis, the reunion of birth parents and adopted persons, and birth siblings or birth grandparents of adopted persons, through a centralized computer network. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on activities under this Act. Sets forth provisions for participation in the Registry and initiation of the matching process. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to protect the confidentiality and privacy rights and interests of all participants. Provides for the collection of reasonable fees for Registry services. Allows the Registry to include similar State systems under specified conditions. Subjects individuals or entities found to have disclosed or used confidential information in violation of this Act to fines and imprisonment. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require the Registry to include referral to existing programs that provide counseling services. Requires, if the Secretary promulgates such regulations, that applicants to the Registry receive a referral list of licensed agencies, professionals, and adoption triad support groups that provide counseling services. Allows such services to include adoption peer support groups, community special service agencies, health professionals, and agencies providing family counseling. Authorizes the Secretary to waive, under appropriate circumstances, requirements which provide that the birth mother, or birth father (with the written consent of the birth mother), or an adopted person over the age of 21 may initiate the matching process by applying to the Registry. Declares that nothing in this Act: (1) authorizes the Secretary to initiate or participate in any legal or administrative action to open a closed or sealed adoption record, unamended birth certificate, or other sealed document; or (2) invalidates or limits any State or local law concerning adoption and the confidentiality of such records. Directs the Secretary to issue interim and final regulations with specified periods. Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act for FY 1989 through 1991.</summary>
