Directs each participating agency of the Task Force to establish a technical transfer and information center that serves as an accessible repository of groundwater information. Requires the Task Force to appoint an Education Committee made up of members who have scientific or educational expertise relevant to groundwater research and management and responsible for reviewing and strengthening academic training programs relating to groundwater. Authorizes appropriations for the preceding activities for FY 1989 through 1993. Amends the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to reauthorize the program providing grants to Water Research Institutes through FY 1993. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate each institute's research at least once every five years to determine whether it merits continued support. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior through FY 1993 for the reimbursement of 50 percent of the costs of additional research or the synthesis of research by institutes on water problems of a regional nature. Title II: Groundwater Research Programs of the Federal Government - Part A: Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency - Directs the Administrator to establish a national research, development, and demonstration program to support the protection, maintenance, and restoration of groundwater resources of the United States. Requires such program to include research, demonstrations, and surveys of causes, prevention, and correction of groundwater contamination. States that priority shall be given to projects which demonstrate the fate of contaminants in groundwater and develop methods and procedures for controlling pollution sources, monitoring water quality, restoring contaminated groundwater, and reducing the contaminating effects of waste materials. Directs the Administrator to investigate the effects on human health and the environment, and on the Nation's water supply needs. Directs the Administrator to establish a media-specific research committee for groundwater resources to report annually for at least five years on the major research issues of groundwater resources, the current status of the research in such issues, and a plan for the succeeding three years. Requires such report to include a list of all major policy decisions affecting groundwater, control technology projects, health effects research, and other research related to groundwater. Makes such report the management plan for the program and requires its review by the Science Advisory Board and submission to the Congress. Directs the Administrator to appoint a Groundwater Research Manager in the Office of Research and Development to carry out such plan and serve as liaison with the Clearinghouse Committee. Directs the Administrator to establish a program of research to develop technologies for the control of groundwater pollution. Requires that such program be carried out utilizing demonstration projects through contracts, cooperative agreements, or grants. Requires the Administrator to evaluate projects on the basis of the potential of the proposed method to effectively control sources of contaminants presenting the greatest risk to human health, the environment, or groundwater and such method's potential application in other locations and circumstances as well as the technical and financial capacities of the project's proposer. Requires the Administrator to supervise and monitor such projects. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs. Directs the Administrator to conduct a technology transfer program and make information gathered pursuant to such program available through a technical transfer and information center.

Requires as preliminary phases to such surveys: (1) an analysis to determine the types and distribution of sources for each category; (2) the development and preparation of techniques and protocols to be used; and (3) the preparation of health advisories for each contaminant. Requires that groundwater quality surveys provide the Administrator with a clear understanding of the need for instituting contaminant source control strategies on a local, State, or national basis. Requires the Administrator to notify the water system or well owner when a contaminant is found, but requires that information released to the public be of a general nature. Directs the Administrator to notify the appropriate government authorities for response when a source for a contaminant is identified. Requires the Administrator to cooperate with the States and utilize the Science Advisory Board in planning and conducting surveys. Requires the Administrator to provide the Congress with a plan for implementing these requirements and a status report on each survey which shall also be submitted to the President, the States, and the public. Directs the Administrator to study and report on the public health effects of nitrates, nitrosamines, and other metabolites of nutrients and nitrogen in drinking water supplies, including sources, levels of exposures, and methods and costs of control.

Requires peer review of all studies conducted under this Act. Authorizes the provision of facilities and equipment for demonstration projects under this Act, limiting construction of facilities on non-Federal land. Requires the Administrator to make grants to universities or research institutions to establish and operate eight groundwater research institutes to conduct research and training and disseminate information on the protection and restoration of groundwater. Bases selection on whether such institute would be located in a region making significant use of groundwater with significant contamination problems and the capacity of such institute to carry on and lead such research.
