  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Social Security and SSI for the Homeless Act of 1987 - Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish and conduct an ongoing program to inform the homeless of, and assist them in securing, benefits available under titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Act; and (2) periodically review Social Security Administration procedures so as to remove technical and bureaucratic barriers the homeless face when filing benefit claims. Amends the SSI program to extend SSI eligibility to residents of halfway houses. (Currently, such assistance is provided to those in public emergency shelter.) Eliminates the three-month per year limit on the eligibility of halfway house and emergency shelter residents. Provides for the classification of chronically mentally ill individuals as presumptively disabled and thus eligible for immediate SSI payments. Provides full SSI benefits to chronically mentally ill individuals through their third month at a medical institution if they continue to maintain and pay the expenses of a home to which they may return upon discharge.</summary>
