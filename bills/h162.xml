  <summary>10/15/1987--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #359 (225-186)) High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act of 1987 - Establishes a Risk Assessment Board (Board) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) review current medical and other scientific studies and reports concerning the incidence of disease associated with exposure to occupational health hazards; (2) identify and designate, from such review and from field assessments, employee populations at risk of disease associated with hazardous occupational exposures; (3) develop a form and method of notification to be used by the Secretary of HHS, and agents of the Secretary to notify the designated population at risk; and (4) determine the appropriate type of medical monitoring, health counseling, or both, that would be appropriate for mention in the notice. Describes the extent of the Board's access to information and data of Governmental entities and of employers. Sets forth factors which the Board must consider in identifying populations at risk. Authorizes the Board, when it identifies a long-latent disease among persons exposed to substances, agents, or processes, to limit notification to persons whose exposure occurred within certain time periods. Authorizes the Board to engage the services of experts in carrying out its activities with respect to occupational health hazards and diseases related to them. Gives priority to Board review of employee populations exposed to occupational health hazards whose members are most likely to be helped through medical monitoring, health counseling, or both. Directs the Board, in making this determination, to consider: (1) exposures for which there exists a permanent standard under specified provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; (2) the extent of medical monitoring and surveillance already available to employee populations covered by the permanent standards; and (3) the need to notify former and current employees. Requires the Board, for such priority review purposes, to consider individuals who have been exposed to dioxin as members of employee populations most likely to benefit from medical monitoring, or health counseling, or both. Sets forth administrative procedures and a timetable to govern Board findings and recommendations relating to the identification of populations at risk and the notification of individuals within such groups. Permits any aggrieved person to bring a civil action for mandamus in the appropriate U.S. district court if final agency action is not completed within 160 days. Requires the Board to designate as a population at risk those health care workers and emergency care workers who are at risk of occupational exposure to the disease known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the virus known as HTLV-III or LAV virus. Directs the Secretary, through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Institute), upon determination that a given class or category of employee is a population at risk of disease, to notify each individual within such population and his or her respective employer. Authorizes the Secretary, in addition, to use public service announcements and other appropriate means of notification. Requires notification via prominent postings at the worksite in certain instances. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for notifying persons who have been subjects of epidemiological studies which demonstrate findings of increased risk of occupational disease and which were conducted by an agency within the Department of HHS. Requires such notification procedures to be included in all future epidemiological studies by such an agency. Sets forth the required contents of such notification, including counseling information. Directs the Secretary to establish a telephone "hot line" for the personal physicians of employees who have received such notification in order to provide additional medical and scientific information concerning the nature of the risk and its associated disease. Directs the Institute to prepare and distribute other medical and health promotion material and information on any risk subject to such notification requirements and its associated disease as it deems appropriate. Provides that, in carrying out such notification responsibilities, the Secretary shall have access to information and data contained in any: (1) Federal agency records, solely for the purpose of obtaining names, addresses, and work histories of employees subject to such notification; and (2) employer records, insofar as Federal access is provided under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
