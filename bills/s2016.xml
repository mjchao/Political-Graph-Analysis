  <summary>1/28/1988--Introduced.
Emergency All-Terrain Vehicle Safety Act - Provides that three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and ATVs designed for use by children under 16 years of age shall be considered to be banned hazardous products under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a final emergency consumer product safety rule for ATVs. States that such rule must require manufacturers and distributors of ATVs to provide: (1) a reasonable refund of the purchase price for three-wheeled ATVs, ATVs purchased for use by children, and ATVs designed for use by children; (2) training in the operation of ATVs to all owners; and (3) a public notice campaign to warn existing and prospective ATV owners of the hazards presented by such vehicles. States that any failure of a manufacturer or distributer to comply with such safety rules shall be considered an unlawful act under the Consumer Product Safety Act. States that the failure of the Commission to promulgate the required safety standards shall result in all ATVs being banned.</summary>
