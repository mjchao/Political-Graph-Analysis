  <summary>12/16/1987--Introduced.
Calls upon the Secretary of State to dispatch a senior U.S. official to Greece and Turkey to consult on possible solutions to Greek-Turkish tensions that diminish the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Supports the Secretary's encouragement of the Secretary General of the United Nations to renew and strengthen efforts to find a solution. Declares that any solution must address the level of military forces on Cyprus, and constitutional and security guarantees for individual Cypriots and both communities on Cyprus. Encourages international organizations to participate in the solution of matters in the Aegean Sea.</summary>
