  <summary>9/27/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #353 (388-16)) Sanctions Against Iraqi Chemical Weapons Use Act - Sets forth congressional findings concerning Iraq's use of chemical weapons and the treatment of the Kurdish people in Iraq. Prohibits: (1) the sale to Iraq of any item on the U.S. Munitions List, (2) the issuance of any license for the export to Iraq of any item on the U.S. Munitions List; (3) the export to Iraq of any goods or technology on the Export Administration Act control list; and (4) the issuance of licenses for the export to Iraq of any chemical that the President determines may be used primarily in the production of chemical weapons or devoted to chemical warfare purposes. Applies contract sanctity for contracts signed before September 15, 1988. Requires the President to impose additional sanctions against Iraq, unless he certifies to the Congress that: (1) Iraq is not using chemical weapons in violation of international law; (2) Iraq has provided reliable assurances that it will not use chemical weapons in the future; and (3) Iraq is willing to allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or other impartial observers, or other reliable means exist to ensure that Iraq is not using chemical weapons. Authorizes the following additional sanctions: (1) prohibiting or restricting the importation of oil, petroleum products, or other goods from Iraq; (2) prohibiting or restricting the export to Iraq of agricultural commodities and other goods and technology under authority of the Export Administration Act; (3) denying Government credits, guarantees of credits, and other assistance to Iraq; (4) opposing any loan or financial or technical assistance to Iraq by international financial institutions; or (5) downgrading or suspending diplomatic relations with Iraq. Provides that in imposing any additional sanctions the President may not prohibit or curtail the execution of any contract or agreement entered into before the earlier of the date on which the notice of intent to impose the additional sanction is printed in the Federal Register or the date on which the President notifies the Congress of such intent. Requires the President to report to the Congress periodically on any such actions taken. Allows the President to lift any sanctions imposed pursuant to this Act if the President determines and certifies to the Congress that Iraq: (1) is not using chemical weapons; (2) has provided reliable assurances that it will not use chemical weapons in the future; and (3) is willing to allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or other impartial observers, or other means exist to ensure that Iraq is not using chemical weapons. Urges Turkey to cooperate with any United Nations or other appropriate investigation of Iraqi use of chemical weapons. Commends Turkey for its humanitarian decision to accept Kurdish refugees. Calls upon the President to: (1) bring before the United Nations the matter of Iraq's use of poison gas against its own nationals; and (2) demand that appropriate and effective measures be taken against Iraq for its repeated use of chemical weapons. Calls upon the President to seek multinational cooperation in: (1) imposing sanctions and otherwise bringing pressure on Iraq in order to obtain a cessation of Iraq's use of chemical weapons; and (2) obtaining Iraqi respect for the internationally recognized human rights of the Kurdish minority in Iraq. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should cooperate with and participate in multilateral efforts to assist Kurdish refugees who are in need of medical treatment and other humanitarian aid. States that it is the policy of the United States to prohibit the export of goods and technology to Iraq that would significantly contribute to its military potential. Urges the President to review any proposed export to Iraq of goods or technology valued at over $50,000,000. Terminates the provisions of, and the sanctions imposed under, this Act as of June 30, 1991.</summary>
