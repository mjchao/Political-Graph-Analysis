Requires foreign persons to report certain information to the Secretary if they transfer interest in such investments. Requires a foreign person who has investments in the United States to report certain information to the Secretary if another person acquires a cumulative interest of five percent or more in such foreign person. Requires registration, if they have certain investments in the United States, by persons who become foreign persons and by foreign persons who change nationalities. Requires foreign persons to give annual updates of their registration information to the Secretary. Sets forth the method of determining whether a person acquires indirectly a cumulative interest of five percent or more in another person. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to monitor compliance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this Act.
