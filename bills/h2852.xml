  <summary>6/30/1987--Introduced.
Federal Employee Family-Building Act of 1987 - Requires any contract for health benefits for Federal employees to also provide benefits for family-building procedures. Provides that terms or conditions under such contracts shall be no more restrictive for family-building benefits than for obstetrical benefits. Defines "family-building procedure" as a medical procedure to overcome infertility (including procedures to achieve pregnancy and to carry pregnancy to term) and procedures relating to child adoption. Requires such contracts to provide that: (1) benefits shall consist of reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses directly relating to the adoption of a child; and (2) benefits shall be available only after the adoption becomes final. Authorizes the use of sick leave for purposes relating to family-building procedures.</summary>
