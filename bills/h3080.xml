  <summary>8/3/1987--Introduced.
Family-School Partnership Act - Establishes a demonstration grant program in the interest of encouraging local educational agencies (LEAs) to increase the involvement of families in the improvement of the educational achievement of their children. Authorizes the Secretary of Education (Secretary) to make demonstration grants to eligible LEA applicants for the development of innovative family-school educational partnership activities designed to: (1) support family efforts to work with children in the home; (2) train families, teachers, and other school personnel to work effectively as partners; and (3) evaluate the family participation in activities of the schools and ways in which to increase involvement in such activities. Suggests possible uses for the grants, including: (1) regular conferences for families of students; (2) training of appropriate educational personnel to foster communication among families, students, and educators; and (3) provision of complementary curriculum materials to families and assistance in implementing home-based education activities. Provides for the participation of private school children, families, teachers, and other staff personnel in the programs and services assisted or carried out under this Act. Establishes within the Department of Education a National Center for Family-School Partnerships in Education (Center). Directs the Secretary, through such Center, to collect and disseminate information and to serve as a clearinghouse with respect to relevant successful programs. Authorizes FY 1989 through 1993 appropriations. Designates a specified percentage of such funds for provisions related to the Center.</summary>
