Prohibits the sale of antifouling paint containing organotin or its application to a vessel unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency certifies that the release rate of such paint is below a specified level. Prohibits the sale of organotin paint additives. Permits the use of existing stockpiles for no more than 180 days following enactment. Sets forth certification procedures. Directs the Administrator to monitor and report annually for seven years to specified congressional officials on the concentrations of organotin in representative estuaries.
