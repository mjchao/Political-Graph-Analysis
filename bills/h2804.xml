Permits the use of both oral and written evidence in the determination of the appropriateness of the certificate, including an appearance in person before the Secretary of Labor by the individual being considered.

Directs the Secretary of Labor to ensure that public employment offices accord to any person so discharged or dismissed but receiving an Exemplary Rehabilitation Certificate special counseling and job development assistance. Directs the Secretary of Labor, no later than January 15 of each year, to report to the Congress the number of cases reviewed under this Act and the number of certificates issued.
