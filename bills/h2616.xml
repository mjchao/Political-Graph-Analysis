  <summary>4/21/1988--Conference report filed in House.
(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-578) Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 - Title I: Health-Care Programs - Part A: Benefits - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to require (currently, authorizes) the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to furnish, on an outpatient or ambulatory basis, needed medical services to a veteran for any service-connected disability, or for any disability of a veteran having a service-connected disability rating of 50 percent or more. Requires the Administrator to provide such services to any veteran receiving benefits due to being disabled during treatment or vocational rehabilitation. Repeals provisions authorizing the Administrator to provide necessary home health services to such veterans. Directs the Administrator to furnish (on an outpatient or ambulatory basis) medical services to any veteran who: (1) has a service-connected disability rating of either 30 or 40 percent; and (2) is eligible for hospital care and whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that would be applicable to the veteran if the veteran were currently eligible for such pension. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish, on an ambulatory or outpatient basis, needed medical services to any veteran: (1) who is in receipt of increased pension or additional compensation based on the need of regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound; (2) who is a former prisoner of war; (3) of the Mexican border period or of World War I; or (4) who is eligible for hospital care under current veterans' benefits provisions. Defines medical services as those reasonably necessary in preparation for hospital admission or to obviate the need of hospital admission. Defines medical services for purposes of veterans who have been furnished hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care. Prohibits such services from being provided for a period in excess of 12 months after the veteran is discharged from such care. Revises the priority among specified veterans for the receipt of outpatient services. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish such home health services, as part of necessary outpatient or ambulatory services, as deemed necessary or appropriate for the effective and economical treatment of the veterans' disabilities. Authorizes home improvements and structural alterations to be provided as part of such home services as necessary, while specifically limiting the maximum cost of such alterations or improvements. Limits the eligibility for domiciliary care to veterans who have: (1) incomes at or below the pension aid-and-attendance level; or (2) no adequate means of support. Revises the definition of "nursing home care" to include nursing care delivered in skilled, intermediate, and combined facilities and to exclude the provision of domiciliary care. Authorizes the Veterans Administration (VA) to contract, on an inpatient or outpatient basis, for emergency care for veterans who have been placed in community nursing homes at VA expense, and for diagnostic services to determine eligibility for a VA benefit. Authorizes the VA to furnish medical care outside the United States for the service-connected disability of a veteran who is in Canada, the Philippines, or, at the discretion of the Administrator, elsewhere. Reduces from six months to 90 days the minimum internment period required for former prisoners of war to be eligible for outpatient dental care. Repeals the current mandatory requirement for the transition from the provision of veterans' readjustment counseling services in facilities primarily set apart from health-care facilities operated by the VA to the provision of such services primarily through VA-operated facilities. Requires the Administrator, after considering the recommendations of the Chief Medical Director of the VA, to submit to the Congress a national plan which sets forth plans with respect to each veterans center in existence on January 1, 1988, for not less than the next year as to its relocation to another VA facility, movement to another location, or closure, and which includes an evaluation of the ways in which decisions about each center would ensure the continued availability of readjustment counseling to persons eligible and needing such services in the geographical area served by such center. Requires the national plan to also include plans to open any new centers. Prohibits any action from being taken with respect to any existing center prior to receipt of the national plan and for 120 days thereafter. Specifies that, after the national plan is submitted, if the VA wishes to change its plans as to one or more centers, the Administrator must submit a revision of the national plan for centers in accordance with the same type of reporting requirements as apply to the initial plan, and to explain the basis for the changes in the plan. Provides that no action outlined in any such revision may be implemented prior to 60 days after such plan revision. Provides that, once the plan is submitted, action may be taken as to the centers covered in the plan only in the way described in the plan or the plan revision. Prohibits delegation of the Chief Medical Director's responsibility relating to the national plan. Postpones by one year the due date of a report from the Administrator on the effectiveness of the readjustment counseling program in meeting the readjustment needs of the Vietnam-era veterans. Provides that payments shall be made to eligible veterans traveling to or from a VA facility or other place for the following purposes: (1) scheduled care or examination; (2) outpatient care or admission to an inpatient health-care facility; (3) VA examination, treatment, or care; or (4) vocational rehabilitation. Provides that the following categories of veterans are eligible for such payments: (1) veterans traveling for care in connection with a service-connected disability; (2) veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; (3) veterans whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension which would be payable if the veterans were eligible for such pension; (4) veterans who are determined by the Administrator to be unable to defray the expenses of such travel; (5) veterans receiving a pension; and (6) veterans traveling for the purpose of a compensation and pension examination. Limits the amount that the Administrator may deduct from payments to a person required to make six or more one-way trips during any month. Prohibits a deduction to be taken from payments made to a person using a special mode of transportation previously authorized. Authorizes the Administrator to waive such deduction in the case of any person for whom the imposition of such deduction would cause severe financial hardship. Directs the Administrator to adjust proportionately the deduction taken whenever the rates of travel expense payments are increased or decreased. Requires the Administrator, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Transportation and veterans' organizations, to take all appropriate steps to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of local transportation networks under which the organization, or individuals who are volunteering their services to the VA, would take responsibility for the transportation of veterans to VA facilities without reimbursement from the VA. Directs the Administrator, no later than six months after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) on the implementation of such requirement. Part B: Pilot Programs and Reports - Extends through September 30, 1991, the authority to provide adult day health care. Extends to February 1, 1988, and February 1, 1991, the interim and final reporting dates for a study of such program. Requires the report on the use of all VA contract-care authorities to accompany the VA's annual budget submission to the Congress. Requires the VA, in order to evaluate the impact on access to VA health-care services for veterans residing in isolated rural areas at least 100 miles from the nearest VA health-care facility, to conduct a two-year pilot program using eight vehicles equipped as mobile clinics and staffed by VA employees to furnish care in isolated rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990. Requires specified interim reports evaluating such program. Requires the VA, within a current required report, to provide information to the extent feasible for FY 1986 through 1988 on the number of veterans being treated by the VA for mental illness disabilities on an inpatient basis and the effects of implementation of the VA's new resources allocation methodology on the number of veterans being treated by the VA for mental illness disabilities. Directs the Administrator to conduct a pilot program to provide care and treatment and rehabilitative services in halfway houses, therapeutic communities, psychiatric residential treatment centers, and other community-based treatment facilities to homeless veterans suffering from chronic mental illness disabilities who are eligible for such care under veterans' benefits eligibility provisions. Authorizes the Administrator to also provide such services to: (1) veterans being furnished hospital or nursing home care by the VA for chronic mental illness disabilities; and (2) veterans with service-connected chronic mental illness disabilities. Outlines criteria for such program and authorizes the Administrator to provide in-kind assistance to facilities being used under such program. Terminates such program on September 30, 1989, and requires a report from the Administrator to the veterans' committees concerning the experiences under such program no later than February 1, 1989. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1988 and 1989. Repeals current contracting authority contained in Federal law. Directs the Administrator, no later than December 15 of the years 1988 through 1990, to report to the veterans' committees on the activities of the VA during the preceding fiscal year to assist homeless veterans. Part C: Matters Relating to AIDS - Provides for the confidentiality of medical records that identify persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), except in specifically described circumstances. Permits physicians or professional counselors to disclose information pertaining to AIDS to a spouse or sexual partner should the physician or counselor believe that the patient will not do so and that such disclosure is necessary to protect the health of the spouse or sexual partner. Prohibits discrimination in admission to VA facilities for treatment of veterans infected with AIDS. Provides an AIDS information and training program for VA employees and beneficiaries. Prohibits any widespread testing program for the presence of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), unless funds have been specifically appropriated for that purpose. Permits voluntary testing for such virus. Part D: Other Matters - Adds to the definition of "Veterans' Administration facilities" those public or private non-VA facilities at which the Administrator provides recreational activities for patients receiving VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care. Permits the VA to authorize the use, for approved purposes, of the VA seal and other official VA symbols and of the name "Veterans Administration" by any person making significant contributions to the VA for support of special recreational activities for the rehabilitation of disabled veterans. Assists veterans' service organizations in providing recreational activities which would further the rehabilitation of disabled veterans, under certain conditions. Allows the VA to accept contributions of funds and other assistance from any appropriate source for the support of such recreational activities for disabled veterans. Permits the Administrator to exercise authority to prescribe limitations on the furnishing of health-care services by the VA only in times of national emergencies (other than periods of war or armed conflict). Increases the per-diem rates payable to State homes for the care of eligible veterans. Authorizes further increases in such rates whenever the Administrator determines that increasing hospital costs warrant such further increases. Adds mental health research as a specific VA research mission. Requires the Administrator to convert underused space in facilities in urban areas to 500 domiciliary-care beds, primarily to be used for homeless veterans. Title II: Health-Care Administration and Personnel Matters - Part A: Administration - Directs the Administrator, no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to take specified action to upgrade and expand certain activities related to health-care quality assurance.
