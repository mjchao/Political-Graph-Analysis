  <summary>7/21/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code definition of "tier 1 railroad retirement benefit" to delete provisions that tie the income tax treatment of certain railroad retirees to Social Security benefits to which such taxpayers would be entitled rather than to benefits actually received under the railroad retirement system. (Under current law, the amount such taxpayers receive in excess of the Social Security entitlement amount is taxed as regular income.) Applies this change retrospectively to benefits payable in 1986 and thereafter.</summary>
