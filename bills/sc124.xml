  <summary>6/9/1988--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United Nations Human Rights Commission has suffered a setback by the election of Cuba and Panama to its membership; (2) the Secretary General of the United Nations should undertake all necessary measures to remove Cuba and Panama from the Commission and should closely monitor Commission actions, including its investigation of Cuban human rights, to ensure its independence and objectivity; and (3) the U.S. Government should consider the implications of such election in evaluating U.S. financial support for the United Nations and the Commission.</summary>
