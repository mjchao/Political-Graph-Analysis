Congressional Advisory Panel on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Act of 1987 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for the development, establishment, and operation of a congressional advisory panel on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (panel). Directs the Secretary to request the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to submit grant applications for the establishment and operation of such panel, with provision for grants to other appropriate nonprofit private entities if the Institute submits no application. Sets a timetable to govern the establishment of the panel. Requires the panel to: (1) advise the Congress and the President concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); (2) analyze and make recommendations for changing health care services and specified public health activities relating to AIDS; (3) monitor the spread of AIDS among given populations; (4) evaluate certain research activities associated with AIDS; (5) assess various efforts, including coordination of efforts among geographic areas, to provide education and share information about AIDS; (6) study the legal and ethical issues relating to AIDS, including their civil rights implications; (7) examine problems encountered by AIDS victims in the areas of employment, education, housing, and insurance; (8) study the effect of AIDS on the armed services; (9) identify financial resources available to address various components of the AIDS issue; and (10) encourage participation by both public and private entities in efforts to prevent and treat AIDS and to assist AIDS victims. Sets forth qualifying criteria relating to the panel and its activities that must be met by applicants for grants to develop, establish, or operate the panel. Requires that the Secretary submit to the President and to each appropriate congressional committee specified data relating to the panel's activities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992.</summary>
