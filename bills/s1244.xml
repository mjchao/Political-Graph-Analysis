  <summary>5/20/1987--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with any physician owing a past-due obligation because of a breach of contract by the physician under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship program. Requires the agreement to provide that: (1) deductions will be made from amounts owed the physician under the Medicare or Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) program until the past-due obligation has been repaid; (2) Medicare payments for services provided by such physician shall only be made on the basis of an assignment; and (3) if the physician does not provide services for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid or if the physician breaches any provision of the agreement then the Attorney General shall sue the physician to recover the amount owed and the physician shall be barred from Medicare and Medicaid participation until the obligation has been repaid. Prohibits barring a physician if such physician is the sole community physician. Requires a State's Medicaid program to make such deductions from amounts otherwise payable. Provides, under the Public Health Service Act, for the collection of such past-due amounts through Medicare and Medicaid deductions.</summary>
