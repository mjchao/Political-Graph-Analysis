  <summary>7/9/1987--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with amendment, S. Rept. 100-104) Airline Merger Transfer Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to accelerate the termination date of the Department of Transportation's authority to approve airline mergers, acquisitions, and interlocking relationships from January 1, 1989, to the date of enactment of this Act. Amends the Clayton Act to make conforming amendments regarding such authority (thus making airline mergers and acquisitions subject to the Clayton Act). Sets forth conditions under which the Secretary of Transportation is directed to impose labor protection provisions regarding the employment status, wages, or working conditions of air carrier employees affected by an application for an airline's merger, acquisition, or consolidation. Transfers such labor protection authority from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Labor. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to compile, on a quarterly basis, information regarding fares and frequency of service offered by air carriers at the 50 busiest airports at which one carrier provides more than 50 percent of the commercial airline service. Mandates that such information be retained for a five-year period.</summary>
