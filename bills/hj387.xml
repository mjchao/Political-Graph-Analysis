  <summary>10/22/1987--Introduced.
United States Forces in the Persian Gulf Resolution - Determines that the requirements of the War Powers Resolution became operative on October 16, 1987. Declares that this Act shall constitute the statutory authorization required under such Resolution for the continued presence of U.S. armed forces in the Persian Gulf. Authorizes the President to continue the presence of U.S. armed forces in the Persian Gulf until the implementation of effective security arrangements which would obviate the necessity for their presence. Requires the President to report to the Congress periodically, but at least every three months, on the situation in the Gulf, as required by the Resolution. Requires such reports to include additional information on: (1) the activities of U.S. armed forces in the Gulf; (2) the steps being taken by other nonbelligerent countries to assist in the protection of nonbelligerent shipping in the Gulf; (3) the results of efforts to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, including achieving a cease fire and a withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries; and (4) how the continued presence of U.S. armed forces in the Gulf is advancing U.S. national security and foreign policy interests in the region. Specifies congressional priority procedures for amendments to this Act.</summary>
