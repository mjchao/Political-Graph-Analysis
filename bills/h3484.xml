  <summary>10/14/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to provide that the General Supply Fund of the General Services Administration shall be available for the following additional uses: (1) utilization of excess personal property and the donation, sale, or other disposal of surplus personal property; (2) sale for executive agencies of personal property; (3) utilization and disposal of abandoned, seized, and forfeited personal property; and (4) travel and transportation management and services. Requires payments by requisitioning agencies to be fixed at prices which shall recover all direct and indirect costs of furnishing supplies and services. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to reduce certain charges as deemed appropriate. Prohibits indirect costs included in prices and charges from exceeding the dollar limitation specified in appropriation Acts. Provides for the crediting to the Fund of proceeds (including charges and expenses) from sales of surplus personal property (except proceeds which must be deposited in the Treasury or credited with the applicable Federal agency or in accordance with contract provisions). Removes the restriction that postpayment transportation audit activities be financed at 40 percent of overpayments collected annually from carriers on transportation bills.</summary>
