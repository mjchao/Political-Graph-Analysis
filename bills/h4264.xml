(Currently, such preference is limited to levels above GS-1 level.) Reduces from 90 days to 30 days the time that must elapse after the Secretary submits a manpower estimate to the defense committees before the Secretary may approve the full-scale engineering development of a major defense acquisition program. Waives such required period during time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress or the President. Reduces such period to 10 days if such estimate indicates that no increase in military or civilian end strength will be required. Title VI: Compensation and Other Personnel Benefits - Part A: Pay and Allowances - Waives Federal provisions requiring military compensation increases in conformity with GS-level increases in the Federal Government, instead authorizing the following increases effective January 1, 1989: (1) a 4.1 percent increase in the rate of basic pay and basic allowance for subsistence; (2) a seven percent increase in the rates of the basic allowance for quarters; and (3) a 4.1 percent increase in cadet and midshipman pay. Revises the schedule of the weight allowances authorized for the transportation of household goods of military members (authorizing a higher weight allowance with each increasing pay grade).

Directs the Secretary, no later than September 1, 1988, to report to the defense committees a description of the manner in which such pilot test program is to be structured. Part C: Other Personnel Benefits - Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a program under which the Secretary of a military department may guarantee compensation of any person who leases a rental unit to any member of the armed forces for a breach of the lease or for damage to the rental unit by the member. Provides that such guarantee shall be accomplished by an agreement entered into between the Secretary concerned and the rental unit lessor. Outlines the terms to be included in such agreements, including a provision which subrogates the Secretary to the rights of the lessor in the case of nonpayment or breach of lease by a military lessee. Provides for recovery from the member involved when the Secretary must compensate a lessor. Limits to the grade in which a member of the armed forces retired the computation of retired pay in the case of a member who, after initially becoming eligible for retired pay, is reduced in grade pursuant to a sentence of a court-martial. Entitles military personnel assigned on temporary duty overseas to travel and transportation allowances incident to personal emergencies. Changes from mandatory to discretionary the payment of a travel and transportation allowance incident to the voluntary extension of an overseas tour of duty. Revises provisions relating to a civilian clothing allowance for members of the armed forces to allow such allowance only for officers who are required to wear such clothing as part of their regular duties. Permits (rather than requires) such clothing allowance to be paid. Part D: Benefits Relating to Incapacitation of Certain Reserve Members in Line of Duty - Revises provisions concerning compensation paid to a member of the Reserves injured or disabled while on active duty, inactive duty for training, or while traveling to or from that duty or training. Provides that the monthly entitlement authorized to be paid to such individuals shall not exceed the member's demonstrated loss of earned income from nonmilitary employment. Strikes the requirement that the period of active duty in which the injury or disability occurred must have been for only 30 days or less (instead, authorizing payment for a disability occurring during any period of active duty) for a member of the National Guard or the Reserves. Removes the requirement that a member of the uniformed services must have died while on active duty for a period of 30 days or more in order for dependents to be provided transportation and travel allowances to attend the burial ceremonies (thus extending such allowances to survivors of reservists). Amends Federal provisions relating to the Reserve Officers' Training Candidates (ROTC) program to authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned to prescribe and conduct practical military training for such candidates in addition to field training and practice cruises currently authorized for such individuals. Provides coverage as Federal employees for such candidates who experience injury, disability, or death from an injury incurred while on such military training, field training, or practice cruise. (Currently, such coverage is provided to such candidates for disability or death from injury and does not cover practical military training.) Includes coverage while on practical military training of at least four weeks in duration for such candidates under applicable veterans' benefits provisions. Part E: Health Care Management Provisions - Directs the Secretary to include in budget materials submitted to the Congress each year (beginning with the budget for FY 1990) a separate statement on the recommended end strengths for all members of the armed forces of each military department who are medical personnel. Requires information concerning the manpower necessary to perform medical missions of the armed forces and DOD to be included in the Defense Manpower Requirements Report. Earmarks specified Navy operation and maintenance funds for the payment of civilian salaries for additional medical support personnel.

Earmarks a specified portion of the Navy's officer end strength for FY 1989 through 1991 to be filled only by health care professionals. Earmarks a specified sum of DOD medical operation and maintenance funds for the sharing of health care resources between DOD and the VA. Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984 to extend through December 31, 1990, the date on which the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation (when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy) may terminate the status of any public health service facility to furnish medical or dental care to members and former members of the armed forces and their dependents. Requires the order terminating such use of a public health service hospital to include a provision stating that such facility is being terminated, among other reasons, because more cost-effective medical and dental care for members and former members or their dependents is available elsewhere in the same geographical area. Revises provisions concerning hospital reimbursement of certain costs by members of the armed forces, former members, and their dependents to authorize the Secretary of Defense to exempt a patient from paying such an amount if the hospital involved does not impose a legal obligation on any of its patients to pay for inpatient care. Makes such exemptions applicable only if there is reasonable evidence that the payment by DOD to such hospitals under CHAMPUS is not greater than the average amount paid for comparable care in the same or a similar geographic area. Part F: Miscellaneous - Extends for one year after a person's final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment a former spouse's coverage as a military dependent for medical and dental care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).
