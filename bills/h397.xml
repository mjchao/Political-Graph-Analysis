  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Treatment Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate ten centers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Requires such centers to: (1) provide a central facility for diagnosis, evaluation, and counseling; (2) develop standards of treatment and methods of delivering cost-effective services; (3) train professionals and nonprofessionals in diagnosing and treating such disorders; and (4) develop a comprehensive acute and long-term treatment program. Authorizes FY 1988 through 1992 appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make $1,000,000 available to each center for each of at least five years for teaching, training, research, and staffing. Permits eligible persons to elect to receive benefits as provided for by this Act rather than under titles XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), or XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act, or under the Older Americans Act of 1965.</summary>
