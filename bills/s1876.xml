Veterans' Administration Child Care Act of 1987 - Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs of the Veterans Administration (VA) to establish on-site child care centers at VA facilities for the care of children of VA employees and, to the extent space is available, other Federal and non-Federal employees. Requires the Administrator to furnish, at no or nominal cost to the centers, space in existing VA facilities, utilities, and other amenities. Allows the Administrator, on a reimbursable basis, to convert space for use as a center and provide other items necessary for the operation of the center. Directs the Administrator to prescribe regulations which: (1) provide for participation of parents in the center in setting operating and oversight policies of the center; (2) require the development of a process for determining the fitness and suitability of prospective employees; (3) authorize the parents to conduct fundraising activities to help defray the cost of operations; (4) require the establishment of a schedule of charges for services, including a sliding scale based on the income and assets of a child's parents; and (5) require compliance with all State and local laws. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) enter into contracts for the operation of such centers with nonprofit organizations comprised of parents of children who would receive child care services in such centers, or other nonprofit organizations which have a demonstrated expertise in the operation of child care centers and have established a parent advisory committee; and (2) provide for the direct management of such centers by the Veterans' Canteen Service, including provision for a parent advisory committee.</summary>
