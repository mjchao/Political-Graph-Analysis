  <summary>4/8/1987--Introduced.
AFDC Employment and Training Reorganization Act of 1987 - Title I: Two-Tier System under AFDC program - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act to establish a two-tier system under which a family applying for or receiving AFDC benefits is assigned to the first tier if it is not a two-parent family and includes a child under one year of age and to the second tier if the family does not qualify for tier-one. Exempts first tier families from this Act's registration, employment, and training requirements. Exempts caretaker relatives, and authorizes the exemption of adolescents, in tier-two families who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent from such requirements if they participate in a program providing a high-school education or its equivalent. Title II: Comprehensive Employment and Training Program - Requires AFDC applicants and recipients to register with a State agency for employment counseling, training, and assignment. Authorizes AFDC recipients to refuse employment which results in a net loss in their income. Directs an agency of each State to: (1) establish a single intake and registration process for AFDC applicants and recipients; (2) determine whether training or education is needed to prepare registered applicants and recipients for employment and then provide counseling regarding prospects and needs; (3) arrange for participation in one or more of the work-related programs established under title IV of the Act or other Federal law, while coordinating such programs to enhance the availability and efficiency of services provided; and (4) develop an employment plan for each AFDC applicant or recipient. Authorizes States to require any AFDC applicant to undertake an immediate program of job search. Accords priority in program participation to individuals who are not required to register yet register for such programs. Requires the State agency to provide AFDC applicants and recipients assigned to employment, training, or education programs with child care and transportation services, otherwise AFDC applicants and recipients need not participate in such programs. Sets the Federal contribution to education, training, and assignment costs as well as administrative and support service costs at 50 percent. Increases, by 25 percent in any fiscal year after FY 1987, the Federal share of education, training, and assignment costs, provided a State meets certain performance standards to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Provides that such standards shall measure a State's success in reducing welfare costs and helping AFDC recipients achieve self-sufficiency, and, at the Secretary's discretion, take into account differing conditions among the States. Requires the publication of such standards within six months of this Act's enactment. Authorizes appropriations for employment, training, and education activities provided to AFDC applicants and recipients. Provides that, after FY 1988, the size on a State's allotment shall depend to a large extent on the State's success in placing high-priority applicants and recipients in schools or jobs. Authorizes States to continue providing a family with payments for child care services for one year after their AFDC eligibility ends. Establishes, in the Office of Family Assistance, an Office of Work Programs headed by a Director responsible for overseeing the operation and effectiveness of this Act's employment and training programs. Sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Makes this title's amendments effective within four years of this Act's enactment, but permits States to make them effective as early as October 1987. Title III: Child Support Enforcement Amendments - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act to direct States to establish binding guidelines for child support award amounts. (Currently, such guidelines need not be binding). Creates a rebuttable presumption that the child support award resulting from the application of such guidelines in a judicial or administrative child support proceeding is correct. Requires States to review and update all child support orders at least once every two years to ensure that they continue to comply with child support award guidelines. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to authorize up to ten States to carry out demonstration projects which require absent parents who owe child support, but whose income is insufficient to pay such support, to participate in a employment or training program. Amends part D of title IV of the Act to require that the names and social security numbers of the father and mother of every child born in a State be recorded on such child's birth certificate. Requires States to adopt certain procedures with regard to paternity determinations and the standard of proof in paternity cases. Takes a State's paternity determinations into account in computing the State child support collection incentive payment. Requires each State to adopt procedures: (1) requiring employers to disclose certain information to the State child support enforcement agency regarding any employee who is under court order to pay child support; and (2) making certain legislation regarding the interstate enforcement of child support effective in the State. Provides that when the State in which the custodial parent resides requests the State in which the absent parent resides to modify a support order, the latter State shall not have jurisdiction to modify any other aspect of the order. Requires that by October 1992 every State have in effect an operational child support management information system. Reduces the Federal share of the costs for such systems. Makes this title's amendments effective three years after this Act's enactment. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate State implementation of this title's amendments and report to the President and the Congress regarding such evaluation within four years of this Act's enactment. Title IV: State Demonstration Programs - Requires States that wish to conduct demonstration programs which include Federal, federally-assisted, or non-Federal public programs designed to alleviate poverty to submit filings regarding such demonstrations to an Interagency Low-Income Opportunity Board which shall select and approve those demonstrations judged worthy of implementation. Sets forth policy goals to be considered by the Board in selecting and evaluating such demonstrations. Directs that special consideration be given to demonstration programs designed to: (1) improve methods of helping welfare recipients achieve economic independence; (2) coordinate employment and training programs currently supported by Federal or State funds; (3) provide transition benefits to those who leave welfare because of employment or increased child support payments; (4) replace in-kind benefits with cash or vouchers; (5) establish paternity and obtain child support orders in AFDC cases for which paternity was not established when the case was opened; (6) provide child care to welfare clients participating in employment, training, work, or education programs; and (7) facilitate efforts by nongovernmental organizations to help welfare clients achieve economic independence. Requires a Governor or his designee to submit a filing which describes in detail the demonstration program to be conducted, including: (1) employment-related activities required of individuals receiving assistance under the demonstration and the circumstances in which they will not be required to participate in such activities; (2) procedures for determining the initial and continuing eligibility of, and benefits for, individuals and families; (3) a budget setting forth the amounts and sources of funding for the demonstration. Requires each Federal department or agency with responsibility for a program which is included in the demonstration program to make an estimate of Funding which, but for the demonstration, would be available for such programs so that the Chairman may compare State budgetary assumptions with such estimate. Provides that when the amount of Federal funds necessary to carry out the demonstration is less than the amount contained in the budget by reason of the effectiveness of the demonstration in achieving the objectives of this title, the State may use excess Federal funds to improve the demonstration or otherwise benefit individuals and families included in the demonstration. Provides that those within a class eligible to participate in a demonstration shall only be eligible for benefits under a program included in such demonstration. Requires the Board to conduct interim evaluations of, and have States submit annual reports on, demonstrations. Authorizes the submittal of demonstration changes for congressional approval if such changes improve the likelihood of accomplishing this title's objectives and participant benefits are not thereby reduced. Authorizes State Governors or the Chairman of the Board to terminate the demonstration (upon giving the Chairman or Governor at least three months advance notice) if the interests of the Federal Government, the State, or the participating individuals would be better served by returning to the separate conduct of the included programs. Requires a Governor, within six months of the completion of a demonstration, to submit a final report on such demonstration to the Board. Directs the Chairman to report annually to the Congress on demonstrations. Directs the Board, after selecting and approving demonstration programs in accordance with criteria it establishes, to prepare a single demonstration proposal containing all information pertinent to the programs selected. Provides that the proposal shall be submitted to the Congress and become effective unless the Congress passes legislation modifying or rejecting the proposal within 60 days after its submission by the Board. Title V: Evaluation of Employment and Training Programs and State Demonstration Programs - Directs the Secretary to convene an Interagency Panel within three months of this Act's enactment which shall design, implement, and monitor a series of studies assessing the methods and effects of the programs initiated under titles II and IV of this Act. Requires the Panel to select an advisory board of not more than 12 members, within six months of this Act's enactment, to provide the Panel with advice and counsel on all aspects of its operation. Sets forth Panel reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for the Panel. Title VI: Method of Financing Program Costs - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the dependent care credit available to individuals whose income exceeds $40,000 and prohibit such credit when their income exceeds $80,000.</summary>
