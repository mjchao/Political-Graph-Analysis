(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 100-328) Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments Act of 1987 - Title I: Mental Health and Alcohol and Drug Abuse Block Grants - Amends title XIX (Block Grants) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991 for block grant allotments to States for prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation projects with respect to alcohol and drug abuse and for mental health services. Changes the formula for determining the amount by which State allotments shall be reduced for failure to implement a State comprehensive mental health services plan. Sets forth requirements regarding a report by the Comptroller General of the General Accounting Office with respect to plan implementations. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to use not to exceed one percent of the amounts appropriated for the allotments in each of FY 1988 through 1991 to conduct evaluations and prepare reports concerning the effectiveness of the block grant programs. Revises the formula for determination and distribution of the allotments. Sets forth requirements for allotment applications, including requirements that the chief executive officer of each State certify: (1) that the funds will be used for comprehensive mental health services and community mental health centers; (2) that the State will establish reasonable evaluation criteria; (3) the specific purposes for which the funds will be used; (4) that the State will use the funds for specified alcohol and drug abuse activities; (5) that the State will use certain funds to provide new mental health services and programs; and (6) other matters. Requires States, in order to receive allotment payments, to agree to coordinate among mental health services institutions the establishment of a State comprehensive community mental health system. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to establish a State mental health services planning council. Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified committees of the Congress regarding the new State mental health services. Amends title V of the Public Health Service Act to require the Directors of the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in cooperation with State alcohol, drug, and mental health agencies and national organizations, to collect data on mental health and on alcohol and drug abuse treatment. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees every two years on drug and alcohol and mental health services. Directs the Secretary, through the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, to develop a model plan for a community-based system of care for seriously mentally ill individuals. Amends title XIX (Block Grants) of the Public Health Service Act to add a new subpart on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991 for grants for projects and programs that seek to reduce the transmission of AIDS in and by users of illegal intravenous drugs. Sets forth a formula for allotment to States of funds appropriated. Requires, in order to receive an allotment, an information and assurances section to be included with a State's application for an alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health block grant. Requires payments to be used to establish programs of treatment for users of illegal intravenous drugs, outreach services to such users, efforts to prevent transmission among such users, and necessary training and organizational efforts. Allows the Secretary, if in the Secretary's judgment a State is unlikely to use available funds during a fiscal year for the specified purposes, to withhold the amount otherwise available to that State in the next fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 for special alcohol abuse and drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programs as provided for in current law. Sets forth a formula for allotment to States of funds appropriated. Title II: National Institutes of Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health - Amends title V (Administration and Coordination of the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse) of the Public Health Service Act to add the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention to the list of agencies of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (Administration). Changes from annually to once every three years requirements for reporting to Congress with regard to prevention efforts of the Administration. Requires prompt and appropriate response to information respecting scientific misconduct. (Current law requires such response to information respecting scientific fraud.) Authorizes the Administrator of the Administration to: (1) accept voluntary and uncompensated services; and (2) conduct and support research training for which fellowship support is not provided by National Research Service Awards and which is not residency training of physicians or other health professionals. Renames the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration as the National Institutes of Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health. Authorizes the Secretary, through the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (Director), to make grants for demonstration projects for: (1) the planning, coordination, and improvement of community services for seriously mentally ill individuals, seriously emotionally disturbed children and adolescents, elderly individuals, residents of rural areas, and homeless chronically mentally ill individuals; (2) prevention services demonstration projects regarding individuals who are at risk of developing mental illness; (3) the prevention of youth suicide; (4) improving the recognition, assessment, treatment, and clinical management of depressive disorders; and (5) the improvement of post-legal adoption mental health and counseling services. Authorizes appropriations. Requires materials developed and published by the Director regarding causes and prevention of suicide to relate especially to suicide among individuals under the age of 24. (Current law requires such a focus on individuals under the age of 21.) Extends through 1990 a requirement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services make payments under allotments to States for community mental health services to homeless individuals who are chronically mentally ill.
