  <summary>9/27/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act to increase the percentage of amounts reserved for vocational education programs for Indians and Native Hawaiians under funds for State vocational education assistance. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from placing restrictions upon grants or contracts entered into for such programs relating to rates of placement of students and adults served by such programs. Requires the Secretary to give special consideration to grants which encourage tribal economic development plans. Earmarks specified amounts for vocational-technical training grants to the Crownpoint Institute of Technology in New Mexico and the United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota. Requires the Secretary, if extra funds for vocational education grants are available under the reserved amounts, to first make grants to institutions of higher education that are eligible for assistance under the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 for developing programs for tribal economic development. Authorizes the Secretary to approve a single application from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium if no such institution submits a grant application. Directs the Secretary to transfer to the Secretary of the Interior a portion of the funds reserved under this Act to be used for activities (other than construction or alteration of facilities) for the benefit of students attending schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide an amount equal to such transferred amount for the purpose of such activities. Establishes the National Indian Center for Research in Vocational-Technical Training. Requires the Secretary to support the Center through an annual grant. Directs the Secretary to designate the entity to be the Center for a period of five years. Sets forth grant application criteria. Requires the Center to conduct research and developmental programs on: (1) the involvement of the private sector in vocational-technical training for Indians and Alaska Natives; (2) the methods for providing quality vocational-technical training to Indians and Alaska Natives and for enhancing basic academic skills in vocational settings; (3) the development of curriculum materials and methods regarding new technologies and assessments of the nature of change in the workplace with respect to tribal settings and economic development; and (4) the identification of institutional, social, and cultural characteristics which improve the preparation of youths and adults for employment. Directs the Center to: (1) research the relationship between training and tribal economic development with respect to employment opportunities; (2) provide leadership development through an advanced study center and inservice vocational-technical activities for tribal and local leaders; (3) disseminate the results of the research projects; (4) provide information to facilitate national planning and policy for Indian tribes and their economic development; (5) provide technical assistance to programs serving Indians and Alaska Natives; (6) act as a clearinghouse for information on contracts and grants providing services to Indians and Alaska Natives; (7) work with tribal organizations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other public agencies to develop planning and evaluating programs, including followup studies; and (8) report annually to the Congress and the Secretaries of Education, Labor, and the Interior on the planning under this Act, the Job Training Partnership Act, and all other programs providing vocational-technical education and economic development to Indians and Alaska Natives.</summary>
