  <summary>12/21/1987--Conference report filed in House.
(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-495) Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 - Title I: Agriculture and Related Programs - Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1987 - Subtitle A: Adjustments to Agricultural Commodity Programs - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set 1988 and 1989 target prices for: (1) wheat at $4.23 per bushel and $4.10 per bushel; (2) feed grains at $2.93 per bushel and $2.84 per bushel; (3) cotton at $0.759 per pound and $0.734 per pound; (4) extra long staple cotton at 118.3 per percent of the loan rate; and (5) rice at $11.15 per hundredweight and $10.80 per hundredweight. Provides that: (1) 1988 loan rates for wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton may not be reduced by more than three percent of the preceding year's level; and (2) 1989 loan rates for such crops may not be reduced by more than five percent of the preceding year's level, plus an additional two percent if the Secretary of Agriculture determines it necessary to maintain market competitiveness. Directs the Secretary to implement a paid ten percent land diversion program for the 1988 and 1989 feed grain crops. States that: (1) the payment rate shall be $1.75 per bushel for corn, with other feed grain rates in relation to such rate; and (2) the Secretary may not implement such program if necessary to maintain an adequate commodity supply in 1989. Directs the Secretary to reduce 1988 and 1989 tobacco by 1.4 percent through price support reductions or purchaser and producer assessments. Directs the Secretary to reduce 1988 and 1989 peanut and sugar program costs by 1.4 percent. Reduces honey loan levels by: (1) two cents per pound for 1987; (2) three-quarters cents per pound for 1988; (3) one-half cents per pound for 1989; and (4) one-quarter cents per pound for 1990. Reduces 1988 milk prices by two and one-half cents per hundredweight. Amends the National Wool Act of 1954 to set 1988 and 1989 wool and mohair price supports at 76.4 percent of the established support formula. Limits 1988 through 1990 transportation loan rate differentials to not more than the national percentage rate plus or minus two percent. Directs the Secretary to reduce FY 1988 and 1989 Commodity Credit Corporation storage costs by $230,000,000. Prohibits the Secretary from establishing an acreage reduction program in excess of five percent for the 1988 through 1990 oat crops. States that the minimum quantity of wheat and feed grains in the producer reserve program shall be 300,000,000 bushels and 450,000,000 bushels, respectively. Requires the Secretary to make yield adjustment payments to 1988 through 1990 producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice if program payment yields are reduced by more than ten percent of 1985 levels. Provides 1988 through 1990 advance deficiency payments for: (1) wheat and feed grains at between 40 percent and 50 percent of the projected payment rate; and (2) rice and upland cotton at between 30 percent and 50 percent of the projected payment rate. Provides advance emergency compensation payments (75 percent ) for the 1987 through 1990 wheat crops. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to: (1) permit, under specified circumstances, the lease and transfer of flue-cured tobacco quotas assigned to a farm after June 30 of any crop year; (2) repeal the required five-year yield factor adjustment for flue-cured tobacco; and (3) express the sense of the Congress that the Secretary should review current compliance procedures for acreage or poundage quotas with respect to cigar and dark-air and fire-cured tobaccos. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit haying and grazing as conservation use acreage under specified commodity adjustment programs except during any consecutive five-month period (between April 1 and October 31) as determined by the State agriculture committee. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) permit unlimited haying and grazing in the case of a natural disaster; and (2) prohibit haying and grazing for economic reasons. Subtitle B: Optional Acreage Diversion - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to provide that producers of the 1988 through 1990 wheat and feed grain crops who devote all or a part of their permitted wheat or feed grain acreage to conservation or other authorized uses shall receive deficiency payments on the acreage considered to be planted to such crops. Subtitle C: Farm Program Payments - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide that as of the 1989 crop year, a person who receives specified agricultural payments subject to limitations under such Act shall be prohibited from holding substantial beneficial interests (ten percent or more) in more than two corporations or entities that also receive such payments. (Permits a person who does not receive such payments to hold substantial interests in three entities.) Requires the Secretary to notify affected individuals and entities. Limits agricultural payments to active farmers. Makes foreign persons ineligible for 1989 agricultural benefits.

Makes other funding changes in both the IRC and ERISA, including revisions of amortization periods and the interest rate applicable to the funding standard account. States that the maximum amount of the income tax deduction for employer contributions to defined benefit plans having more than 100 participants shall not be less than the unfunded current liability. Subpart B: Plan Terminations - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to set limitations or reversions of excess assets to employers upon plan termination. Restricts such reversions pursuant to recently amended plans by treating any plan provision for the distribution of plan assets to the employer and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer as not effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of its adoption. Exempts from such restriction any plan which has been in effect for fewer than five years and which has provided for such a distribution since its effective date. Makes such restriction continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of assets transferred in transactions such as plan mergers. Sets forth a transitional rule. Provides for distribution of assets attributable to employee contributions, if such assets are in excess of the plan's benefit liabilities (i.e. its termination liability), among participants, beneficiaries, alternate payees, and persons who received a total distribution of plan benefits during the three-year period before plan termination. Sets forth a fomula for determining the portion of such remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions. Repeals provisions for the section 4049 trust, the termination trust mechanism for payment of plan benefits above guaranteed levels. Eliminates employer liability to such section 4049 trust.

Declares that the determination of whether distress criteria have been met for a bankruptcy proceeding must be made as of the proposed termination date. Treats a reorganization that has been converted to a liquidation as a liquidation for distress termination determinations. Requires that the PBGC be notified in advance that the entity intends to request approval of the distress termination by the bankruptcy or other appropriate court. Authorizes the PBGC to make arrangements with contributing sponsors and members of their controlled groups who may become (as well as those who are) liable for specified termination liability payments.

Authorizes the PBGC to assess civil penalties for failure to provide any notice or other material information required under ERISA plan termination insurance provisions. Subpart C: Increases in Premium Rates - Increases PBGC premium rates for employers maintaining single-employer defined benefit plans under ERISA plan termination insurance. Increases the flat-rate per-participant premium to $16. Charges an additional per-participant premium to the extent the plan is underfunded. Sets such additional per-participant premium at $6 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits, up to a maximum additional premium of $34 per-participant. Sets forth a formula for the interest rate used in valuing vested benefits for such purposes. Reduces (during the first five plan years the additional premium is in effect) $34 per-participant maximum additional premium by $3 for each plan year for which an employer made the maximum deductible contributions during one or more of the five plan years preceding the first plan year to which such additional premium applies. Makes the contributing sponsor (as well as the plan administrator) of a single-employer plan liable for premium payments. Makes each member of a controlled group liable for any premiums required to be paid by such contributing sponsor. Establishes a separate revolving fund to which such additional premiums are to be credited. Allows transfers of such amounts to other funds, but prohibits their being used to pay PBGC administrative expenses or benefits under any plan terminated before October 1, 1988, unless no other PBGC assets are available. Subpart D: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and ERISA to require security upon the adoption of any plan amendment resulting in significant underfunding. Requires the contributing sponsor (and the members of the sponsor's controlled group) of a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to provide such security in specified forms. Sets forth a formula for determining the amount of such security. Provides for release of such security when specified conditions are met. Requires the employer to include in the annual report to plan participants the relevant percentage if the value of plan assets is less than 60 percent of current liability. Repeals an ERISA provision under which the statute of limitations begins to run on the filing date of a report from which the plaintiff could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge of a breach of fiduciary responsibility. Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess civil penalties for a plan administrator's failure or refusal to file a required annual report in complete form. Makes inapplicable in interpreting the IRC any ERISA provisions for protection of employee benefit rights and for pension termination guaranty insurance, except to the extent specifically provided in the or as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Provides that the determination of the Secretary of the Treasury in a determination letter by the Internal Revenue Service shall not be prima facie evidence on issues relating to ERISA provisions for Department of Labor enforcement of fiduciary standards. Permits a return of contributions to an employer under ERISA if the contribution is conditioned on initial qualification of the plan under specified IRC provisions: (1) if the plan does not qualify initially; and (2) if the application for determination relating to initial qualification is filed by the due date of the employer's return for the taxable year in which the plan was adopted. Limits the ERISA penalty for prohibited transactions to: (1) five percent of the amount involved for each such transaction for each year or part thereof during which the prohibited transaction continues; or (2) 100 percent of the amount involved, if the transaction is not corrected within 90 days after notice from the Secretary Labor. Sets forth additonal ERISA limitations on investment by an individual account plan forming part of a floor offset arrangement and on investment by an individual account plan in employer stock. Restricts treatment of stock as a qualifying employer security. Provides, in the case of a plan other than an eligible individual account plan, that stock shall be considered a qualifying employer security only if: (1) not more than 25 percent of the aggregate amount of stock of the same class issued and outstanding at the time of acquisition is held by the plan; and (2) at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of such stock is held by persons independent of the issuer.

Permits a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation, unless it is part of a tiered structure, to elect to have a taxable year other than the required one, but generally only if the deferral period of the taxable year elected is three months or less. (Current law requires partnerships, S corporations, and personal service corporations, in most cases, to conform their taxable years to the calendar years used by their owners.) Subjects the principals of a partnership or S corporation electing to change taxable years to additional estimated tax requirements to offset any tax deferral resulting from such election. Imposes deduction limitations on a personal service corporation that changes taxable years.

Revises criteria under which members of a partnership qualify for an exception from treatment as unrelated business income of any income from debt-financed real property. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to specified congressional committees by January 1, 1989, (with an interim report due May 1, 1988) on: (1) the issue of treating publicly traded limited partnerships and other corporation-like partnerships as corporations for income tax purposes, including the issues of disincorporation and opportunities for avoidance of the corporate tax; and (2) administrative and compliance issues related to the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships and other large partnerships.

Provides for the recapture of benefits resulting from the use of the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting in the case of certain former C corporations electing to be S corporations. Amends the IRC to impose a 50 percent excise tax on gain realized by greenmail recipients. Defines "greenmail" as any consideration transferred by a corporation to acquire (directly or indirectly) its stock from any shareholder if: (1) the shareholder held such stock for less than two years; (2) at some time during the two-year period the shareholder, a person acting in concert with the shareholder, or a person related to either made or threatened to make a public tender offer for the corporation's stock; and (3) the acquisition is pursuant to an offer that was not made on the same terms to all shareholders. Imposes the tax regardless of whether gain is actually realized. Disallows an income tax deduction for payment of this tax.

Revises the schedule for the payment of estimated tax installments. Specifies that the amount of the required annual estimated tax payment shall be the lesser of: (1) 90 percent of the current tax shown on the taxpayer's return (corporations having a taxable income of at least $1,000,000 for any taxable year during a specified period must use this option); or (2) 100 percent of the preceding year's tax liability. Permits lower estimated tax payments if the taxpayer can show that the installment payments or adjusted seasonal installments made over the year were adequate for each quarter based on annualized income and adjusted seasonal installment concepts described in this bill. Exempts from an estimated tax penalty any taxpayer whose tax liability is less than $500. Requires an addition to income tax when an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax by a corporation, made before the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year, is found to be excessive. Repeals provisions of the IRC dealing with installment payments of estimated income tax by corporations. Amends the IRC to allow employers to elect to have revised withholding certificates put into effect more promptly than is required under current law. Delays for one year, from 1987 until 1988, implementation of the increase from 80 percent to 90 percent in the current year liability test for estimated tax payments by individuals. Prohibits an addition to any tax imposed on underpayments of estimated tax installments by corporations due on or before June 15, 1987, under certain circumstances (thus permitting corporations to use their 1986 tax in determining certain estimated tax installment amounts). Subtitle D: Estate and Gift Tax Provisions - Part I: General Provisions - Extends through 1992 the 1987 estate and gift tax rates, the highest of which is 55 percent (applied to transfers over $3,000,000). Phases out the benefits of graduated rates and the unified credit with respect to transfers of between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000 ($18,040,000 as of 1993).

Part II: Estate Tax Provisions Relating to Employee Stock Ownership Plans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise provisions relating to the estate tax deduction for proceeds received from a sale of employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) or worker-owned cooperative. Makes such a deduction available only if: (1) the decedent directly owned the securities immediately before death; and (2) after the sale, the securities are either allocated to participants or held for future allocation in connection with certain exempt loans or transfers of assets. Prohibits, except in a bona fide business transaction, the treatment of employer securities as allocated or held for future allocation insofar as they are so categorized in substitution of other employer securities so designated. Applies the deduction to any sales of qualified employer securities (current law applies only to sales made by the executor of the estate). Prohibits the amount of the deduction from exceeding: (1) the amount that would lead to a reduction in estate tax liability (before credits) equal of $750,000; or (2) 50 percent of the taxable estate. Disallows proceeds from being taken into account when: (1) they exceed the net sale amount of dispositions of employer securities by the plan during the year preceding the sale in question; (2) they are attributable to transferred assets (except for assets held by the ESOP on February 26, 1987); (3) the sale takes place after the estate tax return filing deadline; or (4) the decedent received the securities under certain specified conditions. Applies the deduction to employer securities that are: (1) issued by a domestic corporation having no stock outstanding that is readily tradable on an established securities market; (2) includable in the gross estate of the decedent; and (3) would have been includable if the decedent had died within a specified time period. Revises the requirements governing the contents of the written statement to be submitted by the executor of the decedent's estate in order to qualify for the deduction. Imposes an excise tax on ESOP dispositions of employer securities for which an estate tax deduction was allowed. Sets forth the amount of tax applicable to relevant taxable events as follows: (1) 30 percent of the amount realized from any disposition of employer securities by an ESOP or eligible worker-owned cooperative within three years of the group's acquisition of qualified employer securities; (2) 30 percent of the amount realized from a disposition (not within three years after acquisition) that occurs before allocation of such securities to participants' accounts in cases when the proceeds are not allocated; or (3) 30 percent of the repayment amount in cases of a payment by an ESOP of any part of a loan used to acquire employer securities from transferred assets. Sets out the ordering rules to govern dispositions of employer securities for purposes of this excise tax and another specified excise tax relating to ESOPs. Makes the excise tax inapplicable to: (1) dispositions to employees, in certain cases; (2) exchanges associated with the liquidation of a corporation into a cooperative or with other reorganizational purposes; and (3) sales effected to meet IRC diversification requirements relating to pension trusts. Places liability for the excise tax on the employer maintaining the ESOP or the eligible worker-owned cooperative. Subtitle E: Provisions Relating to Excise Taxes and User Fees - Part I: Excise Taxes - Extends through December 31, 1990, the three percent excise tax on telephone service. (The tax is currently due to expire as of 1988.) Amends the IRC with respect to the excise taxes on diesel fuel and aviation fuel to impose the tax on the sale of the taxable fuel by producers or importers, including wholesale distributors. (Under current law these taxes are generally imposed on the sale by a retailer to the ultimate consumer.) Repeals exemptions based on certain uses of the relevant fuels, but provides for refunds of tax paid with respect to fuels used for nontaxable purposes. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations to exempt specified types of sales from the tax. Extends until January 1, 2014 (currently January 1, 1996), the potential termination date for the temporary increase in the coal excise tax rate. (An earlier termination date applies if certain solvency conditions are met with respect to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.) Part II: Tax-Related User Fees - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program requiring user fee payments in connection with requests to the Internal Revenue Service for ruling letters, opinion letters, determination letters, and for similar requests. Sets forth criteria to govern such fees. Imposes an occupational tax of $1,000 per year on proprietors of: (1) distilled spirits plants; (2) bonded wine cellars; (3) bonded wine warehouses; and (4) taxpaid wine bottling houses. Reduces the rate to $500 per year for certain small proprietors. Increases existing occupational taxes as follows: (1) for brewers, from $110 per year to $1,000 per year for each brewery, with a reduced rate of $500 per year for certain small proprietors; (2) for wholesale dealers in liquors, from $255 per year to $500 per year; (3) for wholesale dealers in beer, from $123 per year to $500 per year; (4) for retail dealers in liquors, from $54 per year to $250 per year; and (5) for retail dealers in beer, from $24 per year to $250 per year.

Applies a reduced rate for small importers and manufacturers. Subtitle F: Other Revenue Provisions - Part I: Targeted Jobs Credit - Amends the IRC to revise the definition of "wages" for purposes of determining the amount of the targeted jobs credit against income tax. Excludes from the wages applicable to such credit any amount paid by an employer to an employee for services that are the same as, or substantially similar to, those performed by employees participating in or affected by the strike or lockout during the period of such strike or lockout when such employee's principal place of employment is the affected plant or facility. Part II: Treatment of Certain Illegal Irrigation Subsidies - Requires illegal Federal irrigation subsidies to be included in a taxpayer's gross income. Part III: Compliance - Provides that State escheat laws shall not apply to refunds of Federal tax. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Congress should increase outlays to the IRS by specified amounts in FY 1989 and 1990 in the areas of taxpayer assistance and enforcement; (2) the IRS should offer improved taxpayer assistance and enforcement efforts by using these outlays in ways recommended in the Dorgan Task Force Report; (3) the Congress should undertake an experimental multiyear authorization and two-year appropriation for the IRS consistent with specified public law; and (4) increased funding should be provided for both research and the compilation and analysis of income. Requires the IRS: (1) to issue a report by April 15, 1989, on the extent of the tax gap and possible measures to decrease it; and (2) to report annually on the improvements being made in the audit rate, taxpayer assistance, and enforcement efforts.

Creates an exception to permit the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to finance certain tribal manufacturing facilities. Subtitle G: Lobbying and Political Activities of Tax-Exempt Organizations - Part I: Disclosure Requirements - Requires tax-exempt organizations not eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions to include in every written, broadcast, or telephone fundraising solicitation an express and conspicuous statement that gifts or contributions to the organization are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income tax purposes. Exempts from this requirement: (1) organizations having gross receipts of $100,000 or less; and (2) coordinated fundraising campaigns that solicit fewer than ten persons in a year. Fixes penalties for failure to comply with this disclosure requirement. Provides for public inspection, at organization offices, of both the annual returns and the application for recognition of exemption filed by tax-exempt organizations. Protects from disclosure the names and addresses of contributors. Requires that tax-exempt charitable entities (501(c)(3) organizations) provide annual information with respect to transfers and other transactions involving certain other tax-exempt organizations as the Secretary of the Treasury might require to prevent misallocation of revenues or expenses or any diversion of funds from the organization's exempt purpose. Amends IRC penalty provisions relating to required filings by tax-exempt organizations and certain trusts to: (1) revise the maximum penalty applicable in certain cases; (2) fix a penalty for failure to include required and accurate information on a return; (3) fix a penalty for failure to comply with public inspection requirements; and (4) treat the penalties as tax for administrative purposes. Assesses penalties against tax-exempt organizations that willfully fail to comply with public inspection requirements. Imposes a penalty on any tax-exempt organization or political organization that offers to sell to an individual specific information or a routine service that could be readily obtained by that individual free of charge from a Federal agency. Part II: Political Activities - Extends the prohibition against certain political activities by tax-exempt organizations to include activities in opposition to any candidate (current law includes only those activities on behalf of a candidate). Provides that any 501(c)(3) organization whose status is terminated by reason of intervening in any political campaign either for or against a candidate for public office shall never be treated as a tax-exempt not-for-profit civic league or organization. Imposes on a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization: (1) a ten percent excise tax on its political expenditures; and (2) a 100 percent tax on any such expenditure that has been subject to the ten percent penalty tax and has not been corrected within the taxable period. Imposes on the manager of a 501(c)(3) organization: (1) a two and one-half percent tax, to a maximum amount of $5,000, if such manager knowingly agrees to a political expenditure by the organization; and (2) a 50 percent tax, to a maximum of $10,000, if the manager refuses to agree to part or all of a correction of the prohibited expenditure. Identifies the types of expenditures considered to be political. Provides for abatement or refund of any first tier (initial) excise tax on political expenditures if the affected organization establishes that the taxable event was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and was corrected within the proper time. Authorizes a civil action in U.S. district court in the name of the United States to enjoin a 501(c)(3) organization from making additional political expenditures and for other relief appropriate to ensure that the organization's assets are preserved for charitable purposes. Permits such an action only if: (1) the Internal Revenue Service has notified the organization of its intent to seek the injunction and (2) the Commissioner of Revenue has personally determined that the organization has flagrantly participated in prohibited campaign activity, and that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent future political expenditures. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the finding that a 501(c)(3) organization has made political contributions in flagrant violation of the prohibition against such expenditures, to make an immediate termination assessment of any income tax payable by such organization, as well as any penalty taxes due with respect to political expenditures. Sets forth guidelines to govern such termination assessments. Imposes: (1) a five percent excise tax, to be paid by the organization, on the lobbying expenses of any organization whose 501(c)(3) status has been lost because of such expenditures; and (2) a corresponding penalty tax to be paid by the organization manager who agreed to such expenditures, knowing that they could result in the organization's loss of tax-exempt status.</summary>
