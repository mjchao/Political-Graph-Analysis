  <summary>1/27/1987--Introduced.
Biennial Budgeting Act of 1987 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the Federal and congressional budget process by: (1) establishing a two-year budgeting cycle beginning in the 101st Congress; and (2) providing for the separate consideration of authorizations, appropriations, the concurrent resolution on the budget, and the reconciliation bill or resolution. Requires each standing committee of the Congress to review the laws and programs under its jurisdiction in every odd-numbered year to determine whether such programs should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated and whether new legislation is necessary to comply with congressional intent.</summary>
