  <summary>6/9/1988--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United Nations Human Rights Commission has suffered a setback by the election of Cuba and Panama to the Commission; (2) the Secretary General of the United Nations should undertake all necessary measures to remove Cuba and Panama from the Commission and should closely monitor Commission actions, particularly its investigation of Cuban human rights, to ensure its independence and objectivity; and (3) the United States should be mindful of such election in evaluating U.S. financial support for the United Nations and the Commission.</summary>
