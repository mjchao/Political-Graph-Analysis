  <summary>2/18/1987--Introduced.
Amends part A (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require a State plan to deny assistance to an individual under age 18 who is not and has never been married and who is responsible for the care of a dependent child (or is pregnant), unless such individual lives with a parent or legal guardian. Makes such requirement inapplicable if: (1) such individual has no parent or legal guardian who is living and whose whereabouts are known; (2) the health and safety of the child or individual would be jeopardized if such individual lived with the parent or legal guardian; or (3) such individual has not lived at home for at least one year prior to the child's birth or making a claim for AFDC payments.</summary>
