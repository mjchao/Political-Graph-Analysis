Community Renewal Employment Act - Title I: General Purpose and Authority - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to provide employment opportunities to long-term unemployed individuals in high unemployment areas through payments for labor and related costs associated with the repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation of essential community and educational facilities and with public safety, health, social service, and other activities related to the public welfare. Makes individuals aged 16 or older eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 20 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period. Requires that priority be given to those who have exhausted or are otherwise not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, particularly: (1) those who have been unemployed for the longest periods immediately preceding selection; and (2) those residing in families in which no other member is employed on a full-time basis. Requires that special consideration in selecting participants for employment under this Act in employment counseling and other services for veterans should be given to veterans who otherwise meet participant eligibility requirements. Allows, upon certain determinations, up to ten percent of eligible participants selected by a recipient for subsidized employment from funds under this Act to be individuals unemployed for less than 15 weeks. Makes the State employment service agency, in certifying eligible participants and in referring them for employment under title II or III, responsible for ensuring equal employment opportunities and the full participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. Makes each recipient of funds under title II or III responsible for ensuring such opportunities and such participation in the selection of eligible participants for such employment. Requires that not less than 75 percent of title II and III funds be used to provide wages and employment benefits to eligible participants for work which the recipient certifies has been performed in one or more authorized activities. Permits up to 15 percent of funds provided to a title II or III recipient to be used for the cost of administration and up to ten percent for the acquisition of supplies, tools, equipment, and other materials. Permits payment of such costs from non-Federal sources or Federal sources other than this Act. Requires recipients, to the extent feasible, to ensure that supplies, tools, equipment, or other materials purchased or procured have been manufactured, mined, or produced in the United States. Permits title II funds to be used for costs associated with training and related support for a number of participants, if: (1) employers are committed to fill an equal number of unsubsidized jobs with participants who have successfully completed such training; (2) the recipient has an agreement with a qualified public or private nonprofit provider of such training services; and (3) costs of training and support do not exceed, on a weekly basis, the maximum wage payable with funds under this Act. Limits the rate of salaries or wages paid to administrative or supervisory employees from funds available for administrative costs. Establishes a career preparation demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991 for such program. Directs the Secretary of Labor, using the Office of the Job Corps, to establish in each of the Federal regions four career preparation demonstration centers (equitably distributed between rural and urban areas) for combined written, audiovisual, and computer-based materials within the basic instructional format developed by the Job Corps to train eligible participants. Imposes certain requirements on such Centers. Provides that up to five of the Centers shall be designated high technology training centers for training combined with subsidized internship in the private sector for career preparation in high technology occupations including robotics, health technology, and computer operations. Limits payments for weekly costs of such subsidized internship to the maximum wage payable with funds under this Act. Title II: Community Renewal Employment Programs - Part A: Community Improvement Projects - Sets forth provisions for employment activities in community improvement projects. Requires that eligible participants be employed in community improvement projects, in one or more listed activities involving: (1) public facilities repair, rehabilitation, or improvement; (2) public lands conservation, rehabilitation, or improvement; or (3) public safety, health, social service, and other activities necessary to the public welfare. Provides that, for purposes of community improvement projects provisions, "project" means a definable task or group of related tasks which: (1) will be carried out by a government department, public agency, private nonprofit organization, or private contractor; (2) will be completed within 18 months; (3) is an authorized activity; (4) will result in a specific product or accomplishment; and (5) would not otherwise be conducted with existing funds. Permits projects which are to be carried out under provisions for public lands conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement to involve lands other than public or Indian lands only when such projects will provide a documented public benefit and when the recipient will be reimbursed for that portion of the total costs of the project which does not provide a public benefit. Makes eligible entities under title II: (1) States; (2) local governments with populations of 50,000 or more; (3) consortia of local governments; (4) existing concentrated employment program grantees serving rural areas under the Job Training Partnership Act; and (5) Native American Indian, Alaska Native, and Oklahoma Indian groups. Provides that States shall qualify as an eligible entity to serve any area of the State: (1) not under the jurisdiction of any other eligible entity; or (2) for which no eligible entity has filed a statement on the use of funds within 30 days of allotment of funds. Provides that larger units of local government shall not qualify as the eligible entity to serve any smaller unit which is, or is part of, an eligible entity which has filed a statement on use of funds. Sets forth provisions for allotment of title II funds (exclusive of the amount available for part C). Directs the Secretary to reserve two percent of such funds for allotment among Native American eligible entities. Directs the Secretary to allot the remainder among eligible entities on the basis of relative numbers of certain categories of unemployed residents of each eligible entity. Directs the Governor to use the same formula in making available amounts to each jurisdiction within the area for which the State is an eligible entity (but requires that no amount less than $25,000 be made available to any such jurisdiction and that any unallocated amounts be reallocated among other jurisdictions which meet the $25,000 minimum requirement). Sets forth requirements for receipt of an allotment by an eligible entity. Requires eligible entities, within 30 days of receipt of notice, to submit statements which: (1) designate a fiscal agent for receipt of payments; (2) agree to use funds in accordance with this Act; and (3) agree to provide quarterly reports on such use.

Prohibits the Secretary from withholding, suspending, or terminating the payment of any installment of an allotment except in accordance with provisions for sanctions under this Act. Sets forth requirements relating to project design. Requires eligible entities to give priority to projects on the basis of: (1) unemployment severity and duration with localities in its area; (2) the degree to which projects will lead to expansion of unsubsidized private employment opportunities; and (3) the level of need for activities and services to be provided. Requires, to the extent feasible, coordination of employment opportunities established with title II funds with other specified Federal, State, and local activities. Part B: Community Improvement Activities for Youth Trainees - Sets forth provisions for youth trainee activities. Requires that at least 20 percent of the funds available to an eligible entity from its Part A allotment for community improvement projects shall be used for eligible youth wages and benefits for part-time employment up to 32 hours per week. Allows such employment to be: (1) in any authorized employment activity in community improvement projects; or (2) at a worksite operated by a public or private nonprofit agency or organization or by an employer organized for profit. Requires that such employment be provided in a manner which requires, and is consistent with, the youth's enrollment for at least eight hours a week in: (1) high school; (2) a high school equivalency program; or (3) a program of skill training or basic skill or employability development, including a career preparation demonstration program. Permits funds for youth trainee activities to be used in activities which also receive funds under other Federal, State, local, public, or private education or training programs. Makes eligible for youth trainee activities any youth aged 16 through 19 who is certified to be currently unemployed by the State employment service agency. Requires eligible entities, in selecting such participants, to give priority to economically disadvantaged individuals and to serve eligible school dropouts, among such individuals, on an equitable basis. Part C: State Job Programs - Sets forth provisions for financial assistance for State job programs. Reserves five percent of title II funds for each fiscal year for purposes of this part. Allots such funds for this part among the States, in accordance with specified provisions, on the basis of relative numbers of residents who have been unemployed for 15 or more weeks. Requires that such State allotments be used for employment of eligible participants under this Act through: (1) State-administered programs and activities authorized under community improvement project provisions, such as State parks, forests, and conservation programs, State hospitals and other health care facilities, State correctional institutions and programs, and State-administered social service programs; (2) special assistance (in conjunction, as appropriate, with eligible entities under title II) for areas which have experienced sudden or severe economic dislocations, including large-scale losses of jobs caused by the closing of facilities or mass layoffs; (3) State-directed emergency aid programs to cope with natural disasters, including erosion, flood, drought, and storm damage assistance and control activities; and (4) special assistance to seasonal farmworkers and small farmers in rural, agricultural areas which have experienced substantial losses of jobs due to the rising numbers of farm mortgage foreclosures and other severe economic disruption (in conjunction, as appropriate, with eligible entities under title II or with related programs under the Job Training Partnership Act). Directs States to give special consideration to establishing programs and activities which will provide job sites: (1) within areas in the State in which the unemployment rate equals or exceeds the national average; or (2) if there are no such areas, within areas in which the unemployment rate equals or exceeds the State average.
