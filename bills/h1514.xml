  <summary>3/10/1987--Introduced.
Directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR), within 30 days of enactment of this Act, to: (1) initiate an investigation under the Trade Act of 1974 into the acts, policies, and practices of Japan with respect to the importation of rice; (2) consult with Japan with regard to such matters; and (3) make recommendations to the President as to appropriate actions with respect to the matters under investigation. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include as "unreasonable" any act, policy, or practice which denies fair and equitable market opportunities through: (1) the failure to grant import licenses for competitively priced products or commodities; and (2) the operation of a State trading enterprise or government procurement policy as an import-restricting device. Requires the USTR to request proceedings under formal dispute settlement procedures under a trade agreement subject to investigation only if considered appropriate in cases involving agricultural products.</summary>
