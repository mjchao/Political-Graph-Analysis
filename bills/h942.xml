  <summary>2/3/1987--Introduced.
Prohibits launching any space shuttle orbiter unless it is equipped with an escape mechanism which assures that the astronauts aboard will have a realistic chance of survival and recovery should problems arise during the flight as a result of equipment malfunction or hardware defects. Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to: (1) proceed expeditiously with the development and testing of an escape mechanism to achieve such purpose; and (2) periodically report to the appropriate congressional committees on the progress being made.</summary>
