  <summary>10/4/1988--House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment.
(House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment under suspension of rules) United States Grain Standards Act Amendments of 1988 - Amends the United States Grain Standards Act to extend through FY 1993: (1) the Federal Grain Inspection Service's authority to charge and collect grain weighing and inspection fees; and (2) the authorization of appropriations for such purposes. Limits annual inspection and weighing administrative and supervisory costs during such period to not more than 40 percent of total administrative and supervisory costs incurred annually by the Service. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a 15-member grain advisory committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Continues the current advisory committee's existence until all the members of the new advisory committee are appointed. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study of the schedule of premiums and discounts applied to loans under the Agricultural Act of 1949 in order to determine how premiums and discounts can be used to encourage the production, marketing, and export of high quality grain; and (2) report to the appropriate congressional committees by May 1, 1989. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a pilot project for the 1989 wheat, soybean, and feed grain crops to test the recommendations contained in such study; and (2) review such project and report to the appropriate congressional committees within 180 days after the end of the 1989 feed grain marketing year. Amends the United States Cotton Standards Act to permit the investment of proceeds from cotton classing fees, penalties, and sample sales. Directs the Secretary, through the Service, to conduct a study of the effects of including dockage with foreign material as a grading factor for wheat and report to the appropriate congressional committees by June 1, 1989.</summary>
