Amends the National Labor Relations Act to authorize the Secretary of Labor to prohibit the awarding of Federal contracts to persons who have violated certain judicial orders or orders issued by the National Labor Relations Board. Limits the period of such ban to not more than three years after the Secretary has certified the identity of such a person to the Comptroller General. Permits the awarding of Federal contracts to such a person during the period of the ban if the Federal agency or department, after notice and opportunity for hearing to all interested parties, certifies to the Secretary that there is no other source for the material or services furnished by such person.</summary>
