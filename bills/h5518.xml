  <summary>10/12/1988--Introduced.
Congressional Scholarships for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Act - Instructs the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish and implement a merit-based competitive program for awarding a four-year Congressional Scholarship for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering to one female and one male from each U.S. congressional district. Requires the Director: (1) annually to notify secondary schools and colleges of the program; and (2) to establish nominating committees for each congressional district. Prescribes eligibility, nomination, and selection criteria, as well as conditions to be met by recipients in order to maintain eligibility. Limits each scholarship to $5,000 per year, to be used solely for tuition, fees, and room and board expenses. Requires the NSF Director to ensure that both students and nominating committees are selected on a nondiscriminatory basis. Authorizes FY 1989 through 1992 appropriations.</summary>
