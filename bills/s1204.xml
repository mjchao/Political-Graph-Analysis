Home Health Services Demonstration Grants Act of 1987 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities for projects designed to demonstrate the quality of home health care under a system in which reimbursement is based on savings from other hospital or nursing home services.
