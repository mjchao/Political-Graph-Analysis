  <summary>3/3/1988--Introduced.
Natural Gas Transition Act of 1988 - Prohibits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) from permitting natural gas distribution service which would displace existing service provided by a local distribution company (or which could be provided by such local company) if: (1) the State or local regulatory authority certifies to the Commission that the displacing service would prejudice the interests of such distribution company's customers; or (2) the proponent of such displacing service fails to demonstrate that the local distribution company protesting the proposed service is unwilling to provide transportation service on terms in effect or acceptable to the State or local commission. Precludes the Commission from permitting such displacing service until 30 days after it has published notice of such service in the Federal Register. Applies this Act to all service not provided before its date of enactment, regardless of whether the Commission had granted permission to provide such service before such date.</summary>
