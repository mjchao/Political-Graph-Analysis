  <summary>12/8/1987--Introduced.
Condemns the failure of the National Governing Council of Haiti to: (1) support a constitutional transition to democracy; and (2) provide security and adequate protection for the human rights of the people of Haiti and for the security of diplomats. Declares that it is the policy of the United States to suspend all assistance to Haiti, with exceptions, unless the democratic process set forth in the Haitian Constitution (approved March 29, 1987), especially those provisions relating to the Provisional Electoral Council, is being fully adhered to by the Government of Haiti. Directs the President to take steps to promote human rights and democracy in Haiti. Urges, specifically, that the President: (1) use the vote and influence of the United States to halt or discourage the provision of assistance to Haiti by international financial institutions and organizations and other governments; (2) undertake diplomatic initiatives to secure international cooperation to maximize diplomatic and economic pressure on Haiti; (3) suspend Haiti's eligibility for benefits under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act; (4) furnish assistance to the news media in Haiti; (5) furnish assistance to private, voluntary and international organizations, and foreign governments, which might include U.S. participation in international peacekeeping activities; (6) sever diplomatic relations with the National Governing Council; (7) recognize an alternative entity, which is committed to a prompt transition to democracy, as the legitimate government of Haiti; and (8) impose, and seek international cooperation to multilaterally impose, an arms embargo and trade and financial sanctions against the Government of Haiti. Authorizes and urges the President to deny visas to, and exclude from admission to the United States, aliens (and family members and associates thereof) who have been involved in the denial of human rights in Haiti or in activities designed to impair Haiti's transition to democracy. Suspends all assistance to Haiti, with specified exceptions (such as assistance provided by voluntary organizations to meet humanitarian needs, assistance to enable the continuation of migrant and narcotics interdiction operations, and assistance for constitutional elections), unless the democratic process as set forth in the Haitian Constitution is fully adhered to by the Government of Haiti. Specifies that such adherence must include transition to a civilian government elected under the auspices of the Provisional Electoral Council by February 7, 1988. Authorizes the President to provide such assistance as appropriate related to the holding of elections. Requires the President to notify the Congress with respect to: (1) any such assistance provided; (2) actions taken pursuant to this Act; and (3) progress in promoting human rights and democracy in Haiti.</summary>
