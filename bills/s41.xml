  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Establishes the Commission on More Effective Government to: (1) study the management, operation, and organization of the executive branch and its relationship with the other branches of the Federal Government, the State and local governments, and the private sector; and (2) recommend changes in Federal laws and practices (including redistribution of functions among Federal, State, and local governments) to promote greater effectiveness in the transaction of public business. Requires the Commission to keep the President and the Congress informed and to submit a final report with its findings and recommendations within 24 months. Terminates the Commission 90 days after such report is submitted. Directs the Comptroller General, the Chairman of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, and the Directors of the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Technology Assessment to prepare briefing papers on recent reports of their organizations which are relevant to the work of the Commission. Requires the Comptroller General, for a period of four years after the Commission ceases to exist, to monitor and report periodically to the President and the Congress on the implementation of Commission recommendations. Directs a portion of the Commission staff to continue to seek implementation of the Commission's recommendations for a specified period after the Commission is abolished. Places such staff under the direction of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Directs the Director of OMB, in coordination with the executive agencies, to carry out and propose legislation to carry out the recommendations with which they agree. Requires the Director of OMB to make a final report to the President and the Congress on the disposition of such recommendations within four years after the Commission's final report. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
