  <summary>7/15/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat as qualified export assets obligations of a domestic international sales corporation that are: (1) either payable on demand or issued for a term of six months or less; and (2) issued to the corporation by members of a controlled group of corporations of which the corporation is a member. Limits the extent of such treatment to the lesser of $10,000,000 or 20 percent of the corporation's average qualified export receipts for the directly preceding three years. Applies these provisions retroactively to tax years 1972 through 1984.</summary>
