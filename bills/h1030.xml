  <summary>2/5/1987--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract for 30 demonstration projects providing Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) coverage for personal emergency response systems. Requires each personal emergency response system to include: (1) communication equipment located in the home which transmits signals for emergency medical assistance over the telephone; (2) a local response center which monitors such signals and is operated by an agency which offers medical, public safety, or similar services as its primary function; and (3) medical personnel or other persons who provide emergency medical assistance upon notification by the local response center of a Medicare participant's need for such assistance. Directs the Secretary to evaluate such projects and transmit a report to the Congress by July 1990 which includes legislative recommendations concerning the efficiency and economic feasibility of providing Medicare coverage for such systems. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989.</summary>
