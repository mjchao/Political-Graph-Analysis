  <summary>3/1/1988--Introduced.
Declares that any settlement in Afghanistan must: (1) provide for Afghan self-determination; (2) outline a definite timetable for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops; and (3) provide for the safe return of refugees. Urges the President to support a solution acceptable to the Afghan resistance, insist on the withdrawal of Soviet advisers with the troops, require the Soviets to terminate all forms of military assistance to the Kabul regime, and ensure continued international assistance to the Afghan refugees until all Soviet bloc forces have been withdrawn. Expresses the Senate's: (1) support for increased U.S. humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people during and following a Soviet withdrawal; (2) support for a United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping force; and (3) belief that the U.S. Government should not restrict assistance to the Afghan resistance until it is clear that the Soviets have ended their occupation and that the majahadeen can maintain its integrity during the transition period leading to new elections.</summary>
