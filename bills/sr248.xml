  <summary>7/30/1987--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should continue to make clear the support of the United States for the Haitian people's efforts to establish a democracy; (2) Haiti's National Council of Government (Council) should respect and abide by decisions made by the Provisional Election Council in conducting elections called for under the new Haitian constitution; (3) the Council should be mindful of and responsive to conditions placed upon the provision of U.S. economic and military assistance to Haiti with particular attention to specified conditions concerning free elections and human rights improvements; (4) the Haitian armed forces should respect human rights and exercise restraint in carrying out their duties; (5) the Council should redouble its efforts to demonstrate clear and tangible progress in investigations into past human rights abuses by members of the Haitian armed forces and to put into place safeguards against future abuses; and (6) all Haitians need to work to avoid further violence and allow the democratic transition to proceed in a peaceful atmosphere.</summary>
