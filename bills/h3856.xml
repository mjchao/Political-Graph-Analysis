Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act - Continues on the reserve active status list certain Army and Air Force reserve colonels and brigadier generals who would otherwise be discharged from such active status due to age or years in service. Outlines certain promotion and failure of selection provisions concerning reserve officers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force who are subject to placement on the reserve active status lists and who come up for promotion to a higher reserve grade. Authorizes, for a specified period, the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force to prescribe minimum periods of total years of commissioned service for promotion consideration for reserve officers who are subject to placement on the reserve active status list of the Army or Air Force. Requires all officers due to be placed on the reserve active status list of their armed forces to be placed on such list with the same relative seniority as they held on the day before the effective date of this Act. Revises provisions concerning the determination of the highest grade held for purposes of computation of retired pay of officers required to perform satisfactorily on the reserve active status list. Title I: Promotion and Involuntary Separation of Officers on the Reserve Active Status List - Amends general military law provisions to direct the Secretary of the military department concerned, whenever the needs of the service require, to convene selection boards to make recommendations: (1) for promotion of officers on the reserve active status list in each permanent grade to the next higher grade; and (2) for continuation of officers on the reserve active status list or for selective early removal from such list (including requiring an officer to show cause for retention). Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to notify officers eligible for promotion in advance that a selection board is to convene.

Authorizes the Secretary concerned to prescribe longer minimum periods of in-grade service in certain instances. Authorizes the Secretary concerned, in the case of an officer holding the grade of major or lieutenant commander in a reserve component, to also prescribe a minimum period of total years of commissioned service. Requires that certain ranked officers on the reserve active status list who are ineligible for promotion due to an insufficient period of in-grade service shall be placed in a zone of consideration and considered for promotion far enough in advance that such promotion would be effective on the date of eligibility due to completion of such required service. Requires each officer whose name appears on a reserve active status list to be placed in a competitive category for promotion. Directs the Secretary concerned to establish a promotion zone for officers serving in each grade and competitive category. Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to implement regulations that require that a promotion zone for consideration of officers above the rank of ensign or second lieutenant be determined in accordance with a running mate system. Directs the Secretary concerned, before convening a selection board, to determine the maximum number of officers in each competitive category that the selection board may recommend for promotion. Authorizes the Secretary concerned, when the needs of the armed forces so require, to recommend officers of a certain rank for promotion from below the promotion zone. Directs the Secretary concerned, after the report of a promotion selection board has been approved by the President, to place the names of all officers selected for promotion on a list (a promotion list) in the order of seniority of those officers on the reserve active status list.

Provides that a reserve officer below the grade of colonel, or captain in the Naval Reserve, who is eligible for promotion but either is not selected for, or declines the offer of, a promotion shall be considered to have failed selection for promotion. Outlines other instances in which an officer shall be considered to have failed selection for promotion. Directs the Secretary concerned to convene a special selection board in the case of an officer who was: (1) not considered for promotion because of administrative error; and (2) eligible for promotion, considered, but not selected because the action of the first selection board was contrary to law or contained material or administrative error or because such board lacked material information.

Provides for promotion of an officer recommended for promotion in a report by the special selection board which is approved by the President.
