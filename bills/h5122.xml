Amends the Federal criminal code to provide penalties for the disclosure by Federal employees of information: (1) that is related to a specific procurement, if sealed bids have been solicited or competitive proposals have been requested and the award of a contract has not yet been made; or (2) that is related to a specific plan or program for a procurement, in relation to which neither sealed bids have been solicited nor competitive proposals requested; and that, taken alone or together with other information, would reasonably be expected to afford a prospective competitor an advantage over other prospective competitors.</summary>
