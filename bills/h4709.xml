  <summary>5/26/1988--Introduced.
Establishes the Los Luceros National Monument in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land within the boundaries of the monument only by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. Provides for: (1) the acquisition of tracts partially outside such boundaries under certain conditions; (2) the acquisition of lands within the monument's boundaries which are owned by the State or any political subdivision thereof only by donation or exchange; and (3) the acquisition of land within the monument's boundaries from any individual who notifies the Secretary that the continued ownership of such property is causing, or would result in, undue hardship. Directs the Secretary to establish at the monument the Juan de Onate Interpretive Center to interpret the historic events and cultural resources relating to the monument and the history of the Spanish colonization of the interior of the United States. Requires the center to be managed by the Secretary, through the National Park Service, in cooperation with State, county, and municipal officials, local and State historical associations, and the Indian community. Specifies that the center shall include an interpretation of: (1) the historical significance of the expedition and colonization led by Juan de Onate; (2) the relationship between the Los Luceros Hacienda and the original 15 haciendas established by Onate as part of the first settlement in the colonization of the United States; and (3) the role of the Pueblo Indian during the Spanish colonization period. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) conduct a feasibility study, in cooperation and coordination with the San Juan Pueblo, to determine whether the San Gabriel National Historic Landmark should be designated as a national historic site; and (2) report the results and conclusions within one year after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
