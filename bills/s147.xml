  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Government Impelled Cargo Act of 1987 - Requires that all waterborne cargo affecting the national security of the United States be transported in U.S.-flag vessels. Requires transportation in such vessels of 50 percent of cargo not affecting the national security when the Government is involved directly. Makes certain exceptions when no U.S.-flag vessel is available at competitive rates, and when a declared emergency exists. Sets forth directives for agency compliance with this Act and repeals specified laws to conform to its provisions. Establishes a similar requirement where the Government's involvement is indirect, consisting of financial assistance used to pay: (1) at least 50 percent of the cargo; or (2) for any of the foreign charges.</summary>
