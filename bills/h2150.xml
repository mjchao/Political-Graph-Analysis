  <summary>4/23/1987--Introduced.
Trade and Export Enhancement Act of 1987 - Title I: Trade Law Amendments - Subtitle A: National Trade Policy and Agenda - Sets forth the national trade policy and agenda which shall guide U.S. trade policy. Requires the President to use all appropriate powers to achieve such policy, including: (1) recommending appropriate changes in implementing fiscal, regulatory, and economic policy to the Congress; (2) making greater efforts to coordinate economic and monetary policy with the major U.S. trading partners; (3) utilizing trade policy measures to expand markets for U.S. exports, discipline unfair trade policies of foreign countries, and negotiate a more open world trading system; and (4) effecting better management of Third World debt. Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to submit to the Congress a statement on: (1) U.S. trade policy objectives and priorities; and (2) actions authorized under U.S. trade laws and negotiations with foreign countries to achieve such objectives; (3) proposed legislation to achieve such objectives; and (4) progress made during the preceding year in achieving such objectives. Requires the USTR to consult with appropriate congressional committees before submitting such statement. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President to seek information and advice from the private and public sectors with respect to negotiating objectives of and operations under proposed trade agreements under the Trade and International Economic Policy Reform Act of 1987 (Act of 1987) and with respect to the development of U.S. trade policy. Directs the President to establish an Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations. Permits the President to establish other advisory committees for services, investment, agriculture, defense, industry, and labor to provide general trade advice. Requires the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations and appropriate advisory committees to meet and report to the President, the Congress, and the USTR on trade agreement negotiations entered pursuant to the Act of 1987. Requires the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to apply to such committees. Restricts the disclosure of trade secrets and commercial or financial information submitted in confidence to congressional advisers for trade policy in connection with trade agreement negotiations. Directs, at the beginning of each regular session of the Congress, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to designate congressional advisers on trade policy and negotiations to provide advice on the development of trade policy. Requires such advisers to be accredited by the USTR as official advisers to the U.S. delegations to international trade negotiations. Provides for the accreditation of additional congressional advisers regarding specific trade policy matters or negotiations. Requires the USTR to consult with the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance with respect to overall U.S. trade policy. Requires the USTR to transmit to the Congress any trade agreement that is entered into under the Act of 1987. Requires the President to submit to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance trade competitiveness impact statements with respect to trade agreements that may affect the competitiveness of U.S. industries. Waives such requirement if the President determines that it is necessary to serve the national interest or to deal with an emergency situation. Subtitle B: Trade Agreement Negotiating Authority, Enforcement of United States Rights Under Trade Agreements, and Response to Foreign Trade Practices - Chapter 1: Trade Agreement Negotiating Authority - Declares that the overall U.S. negotiating objectives with respect to trade agreements are to obtain: (1) more open and equitable market access; (2) the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of trade barriers; and (3) a more effective system of international trading procedures. Sets forth the principal U.S. trade negotiating objectives with respect to: (1) agricultural trade; (2) dispute settlement; (3) unfair trade practices; (4) trade in services; (5) trade in intellectual property; (6) foreign direct investment; (7) safeguard measures; (8) improvement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and multilateral trade negotiation agreements; (9) tariff and nontariff trade barriers; (10) worker's rights; (11) trade with developing countries; (12) market access to high technology; (13) current account surpluses; and (14) trade and monetary coordination. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the USTR should enter into negotiations with foreign countries to achieve the elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers and unfair trade practices with respect to U.S. agricultural products and forest products. Declares it to be U.S. policy to use the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations to enter into multilateral agreements that achieve increased market opportunities for U.S. exports. Grants the President the authority, whenever he determines that one or more existing duties or import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States, to: (1) enter, until January 3, 1993, into trade agreements with foreign countries; and (2) proclaim any modification or continuance of duties, continuance of duty-free treatment, or imposition of additional duties, as appropriate. Grants the President the authority to enter into trade agreements with foreign countries to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate trade barriers or distortions or to prohibit or limit the imposition of such barriers if he determines that such barriers unduly burden or restrict U.S. commerce or adversely affect the U.S. economy or that the imposition of such barriers is likely to result in a burden, restriction, or adverse effect. Grants the President the authority, until January 3, 1993, to enter into bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries to eliminate or reduce U.S. duties or trade barriers or distortions to international trade of a foreign country or the United States. Authorizes the President to enter into a trade agreement to implement the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Requires the President, before entering into such trade agreements, to consult with specified congressional committees. Sets forth the procedure for entering into a trade agreement to reduce trade barriers or to prohibit the imposition of such barriers. Requires the President, in connection with any proposed trade agreements under specified provisions of this Act or the Act of 1987, to publish and furnish the International Trade Commission (ITC) with lists of articles which may be considered for modification or continuance of duties, continuance of duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties. Authorizes the President, in connection with non-tariff trade agreements, to publish and furnish the ITC with lists of non-tariff matters which may be considered for modification. Requires the ITC, with respect to each article or non-tariff matter, to advise the President of the probable economic effects of such modifications on: (1) industries producing like or directly competitive articles; and (2) U.S. manufacturing, agriculture, mining, fishing, services, intellectual property, investment, labor, and consumers. Requires the ITC, in order to assist the President with respect to entering proposed trade agreements and developing U.S. trade policy, to investigate and report to the President as to the effects of modification of any barrier or other distortion to international trade on domestic workers, industries or sectors, purchasers, prices, and quantities of articles in the United States. Sets forth specified actions the ITC must take in preparing advice on trade matters to the President. Requires the President, before entering certain trade agreements, to: (1) seek information and advice with regard to such an agreement from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Interior, Labor, State, and Treasury and from the USTR; and (2) hold public hearings for comments. Permits the President, when seeking certain trade agreements, to make a formal offer for the modification or continuance of any U.S. duty, import restrictions, barriers or distortions to international trade, the continuance of U.S. duty free or excise treatment, or the imposition of additional duties, import restrictions, or other barriers to international trade, including trade in services, foreign direct investment, and intellectual property, with respect to any article or matter only after receiving a summary of the public hearings on such actions and advice from the ITC. Authorizes the President, whenever specified actions increase or impose a duty or import restriction, to enter into trade agreements to grant new concessions as compensation to a foreign country that has an existing trade agreement with the United States or proclaim modification or continuance of existing duties or duty-free treatment with respect to such agreement if it is necessary to meet U.S. international obligations. Authorizes the President, with regard to trade negotiations with Canada, to enter into tariff agreements relating to specified items of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, and to proclaim the modification or elimination of existing duties on such items. Limits the President's authority to the following items: (1) dialysis cyclers; (2) packaging goods for tea; (3) dried fababeans; (4) cat litter; (5) mechanics' tool boxes; (6) medical tubing; (7) synthetic fireplace materials; (8) spirits; (9) miners' safety lamps, components,and battery chargers; (10) computerized paper cutter control retrofit units; and (11) frozen cranberries. Requires the President to proclaim such changes only to the extent that tariff concessions of equivalent value are granted by Canada in exchange for reductions authorized by this Act. Terminates the President's authority five years after enactment of this Act. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to implement changes in the tariff treatment of the following products pursuant to the United States-European Communities Agreement on Citrus and Pasta: (1) anchovies; (2) certain cheeses; (3) satsuma oranges (mandarin); (4) olives; (5) capers; (6) paprika; (7) cider; and (8) olive oil. Authorizes the President to modify or terminate such changes at any time. Requires the President to update each report on wine exports that the President submitted to specified congressional committees pursuant to the Wine Equity and Export Expansion Act of 1984. Requires each updated report to contain: (1) a description of the tariff or nontariff barriers to trade in U.S. wine of each major wine trading country with respect to which the USTR has carried out consultations; (2) the status of such consultations; and (3) other information based on developments since the submission of the President's report on wine exports. Chapter 2: Enforcement of United States Rights Under Trade Agreements and Response to Foreign Trade Practices - Requires the USTR (currently, the President) to take action if he determines that U.S. rights under any trade agreement are being denied or a foreign country's act, policy, or practice: (1) is inconsistent with, or denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement; or (2) is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Requires the USTR, unless the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) make a specified finding or the USTR makes a specified finding, to: (1) suspend or remove certain benefits of the trade agreement, impose restrictions on the foreign country involved, or withdraw benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences; or (2) restrict imports of services; or (3) both (1) and (2); and (4) take all other appropriate and feasible actions to enforce such rights or end such act, policy, or practice. Defines export targeting as any government plan consisting of a combination of actions that are bestowed on a specific enterprise or group of enterprises which improves the competitiveness of exports by such enterprise or group. Requires the USTR, if he determines that export targeting exists and is a burden or restriction to U.S. commerce, to: (1) take action under (1) or (2), or both; (2) enter into agreement with the foreign country that provides a solution to such burden or restriction, or provides compensatory trade benefits; or (3) take a combination of such actions, to eliminate such export targeting. Provides that the USTR is not required to take such actions if he: (1) finds that such action is not in the national economic interest of the United States; and (2) complies with specified reporting requirements. Sets forth the alternative actions available to the USTR. Requires action taken to eliminate: (1) an act, policy, or practice that denies U.S. rights under a trade agreement or burdens U.S. commerce; or (2) export targeting, to be devised to affect goods or services of the foreign country involved in an amount equivalent to the amount that such country restricts U.S. commerce. Requires the USTR to report to the Congress on each action taken or the reasons no action was taken to: (1) enforce U.S. rights or eliminate unfair trade acts, policies, or practices; or (2) eliminate the export targeting policy or practice. Requires the USTR to take all appropriate and feasible action to eliminate: (1) export targeting by a foreign country that threatens to burden or restrict U.S. commerce; and (2) a foreign country's act, policy, or practice which is unreasonable or discriminating and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Sets forth provisions relating to the scope of action that the USTR (currently, the President) may take with respect to: (1) a foreign country's act, policy, or practice that denies U.S. rights under a trade agreement or burdens U.S. commerce; or (2) export targeting practices. Authorizes the USTR with respect to such unfair trade practices to withdraw or refrain from proclaiming certain benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences. Requires the USTR in response to such trade practices to: (1) give preference to the imposition of duties over the imposition of other import restrictions; (2) if an import restriction other than a duty is imposed, consider substituting, on an incremental basis, an equivalent duty for such other import restriction; and (3) before determining to take action to restrict imports, take into account the likely impact on U.S. agricultural exports. Authorizes the USTR (currently, the President) to: (1) restrict the terms and conditions of service sector access authorization; or (2) deny the issuance of such authorization. Requires the USTR, within 30 days of making a decision to take action to enforce U.S. trade rights or provide relief from foreign unfair trade practices, to implement such action. Authorizes the USTR to delay such implementation for up to 90 days if: (1) either the petitioner or the domestic industry that would benefit from such action requests the delay; or (2) the USTR determines that substantial progress towards a solution is being made. Defines "unreasonable" to include an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country that denies: (1) certain worker's rights; or (2) market opportunities to U.S. firms. Requires the USTR to direct certain inquiries to the foreign countries involved in an investigation of unfair trade practices. Authorizes the USTR to request the foreign countries to provide documentation or permit verification of information. Authorizes the USTR to disregard such information and instead use the best information available if the information provided by the foreign country is not timely, is incomplete, or is insufficiently verified. Requires the USTR to initiate formal dispute settlement procedures contained under a trade agreement if a resolution of unfair trade practices is not reached after consultation with the foreign country. Requires the USTR, subject to certain consultation requirements, to: (1) determine whether U.S. rights under a trade agreement are being denied or an unfair trade act, policy, or practice exists; and (2) take action to enforce any trade rights or remedy any unfair trade practices. Authorizes the USTR to determine an act, policy, or practice that denies worker's rights not to be unreasonable if he finds that the foreign country has taken steps to provide those rights to the workers. Changes the timetable for the USTR to determine whether action is required with respect to unfair trade practices and export targeting. Requires the USTR, before taking action with respect to the product or service of a foreign country which is the subject of an unfair trade practice petition to, provide an opportunity for presentation of views by interested persons, including a public hearing, if requested by such persons. Requires the USTR, if export targeting is involved, to consult with representatives of the industry and workers affected by such targeting with respect to the appropriate remedial action, including measures to enhance the international competitiveness of such industry. Authorizes USTR to modify or terminate an action taken to enforce U.S. trade rights if: (1) the contracting parties to the GATT make specified findings; or (2) the USTR determines that the foreign act, policy, or practice has been eliminated or is being phased out or that the action is not effective or that its continuation is not in the national economic interest. Requires the USTR to review and assess biennially the results of actions taken to enforce U.S. rights. Provides for publication of, and notification of the Congress of, any modification or termination. Requires the USTR to monitor the implementation of every measure undertaken or agreement entered into by a foreign country to enforce U.S. trade rights or eliminate unfair trade practices or export targeting. Requires the ITC to: (1) determine whether each major exporting country is an excessive trade surplus country for 1987 through 1990; and (2) determine if the percentage obtained by dividing the U.S. balance of trade deficit by the U.S. gross national product is less than one and one-half percent. Requires the ITC to report such determinations to the USTR. Requires the USTR, within 15 days of receipt of such report, to determine whether each major exporting country identified as an excessive trade surplus country maintained a pattern of unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory trade policies or practices that have a significant adverse effect on U.S. commerce and contribute to the excessive trade surplus of that country. Sets forth factors to be considered in making such determination. Provides that the USTR need not make such determination with respect to countries with a percentage of less than one and one-half percent. Defines "excessive trade surplus country" as a major exporting country which has: (1) a bilateral export percentage (the value of nonpetroleum export to, divided by the value of nonpetroleum imports from, the United States) of more than 175 percent; (2) a bilateral trade surplus (an excess of the value of nonpetroleum exports to, over the nonpetroleum imports from, the United States) for the year; and (3) a global trade surplus (the aggregate value of all exported merchandise exceeds the aggregate value of all imported merchandise) for the year. Requires the USTR to try to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement to reduce such surplus with each foreign country that is designated as an excessive and unwarranted trade surplus country. Requires the USTR, if the negotiations do not achieve such surplus reductions within a specified time, to: (1) suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of benefits of trade agreement concessions with respect to such country; or (2) impose duties or other import restrictions on such country's products. Sets forth waiver provisions with respect to the USTR taking such actions. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to determine if any foreign country that is designated an excessive surplus country is maintaining its currency at an artificially low level that does not reflect such country's competitive strength in international trade. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to negotiate an agreement to realign each country's currency that is maintained at an artificially low level. Provides for the administration of the provisions relating to trade deficits. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the USTR conclude all cases under a specified section of the Trade Act of 1974 that involve unfair foreign agricultural export practices, including export subsidies and differential export taxes. Subtitle C: Relief From Injury Caused by Import Competition - Chapter 1: Industry Relief From Injury Caused by Import Competition - Requires petitions for import relief to: (1) include a statement describing the specific purposes for which import relief is being sought; (2) if critical circumstances are alleged to exist, include information supporting that allegation; and (3) if injury is caused by imports of perishable agricultural products, permit a request for emergency relief. Permits a petitioner to submit to the ITC and the USTR a statement of proposed industry adjustment measures to make an industry affected by imports more competitive. Permits an entity representing a domestic industry to file a request with the USTR for the monitoring of imports of perishable agricultural products if such entity: (1) produces a perishable agricultural product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agricultural product; and (2) has reason to believe that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the industry. Requires the USTR to determine if: (1) the imported product is a perishable agricultural product; and (2) there is a reasonable indication that the domestic industry is vulnerable to serious injury or the threat thereof as a result of such increased imports. Requires the ITC, if such determinations are affirmative, to monitor and investigate such imports for a period not to exceed two years. Permits a petitioner to request emergency relief with respect to such imports. Defines "perishable agricultural product" as any agricultural article, including livestock, which the USTR considers action under this section to be appropriate after taking into account: (1) whether the article has a short shelf life, a short growing season, or a short marketing period; (2) whether such article is treated as a perishable product under any Federal law; and (3) any other appropriate factors. Requires the ITC to investigate whether an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat of injury, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article upon: (1) the filing of a petition; (2) the request of the President or the USTR; (3) resolution of either the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee; or (4) its own motion. Requires the ITC, if a petition alleges that critical circumstances exist, to determine whether such circumstances do exist. Sets forth economic factors that the ITC shall consider in making its determination. Requires the ITC, in the course of any such investigation, to: (1) seek information on actions by firms and workers in the industry to increase the industry's competitiveness; (2) investigate any factor which may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation and notify the appropriate agency if the ITC has reason to believe that dumping is causing the increased imports; and (3) hold public hearings on the subject of the investigation. Requires the ITC to: (1) determine whether increased imports are a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the industry; and (2) if such determination is affirmative and the petition alleged critical circumstances, determine if critical circumstances exist. Requires the ITC, if it determines that critical circumstances exist, to direct the Commissioner of Customs to order the suspension of the liquidation of all articles subject to the determination that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of publication of notice of the order in the Federal Register. Authorizes the ITC to direct the Commissioner to order the posting of a bond for the entry of such articles to which the suspension of liquidation applies. Requires the ITC, after making a determination that serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry exists, to determine the form and amount of import relief that would be most effective: (1) in preventing or remedying such injury; and (2) in facilitating the efforts by the domestic industry to enhance its long-term competitiveness or to adjust to import competition. Requires the ITC to report its findings to the USTR within 180 days of the date the petion is filed. Sets forth information to be included in such report. Prohibits another import relief investigation with respect to the same subject matter unless one year has passed since the ITC's report or the ITC determines that good cause for such repeat investigation exists. Requires the ITC, within 48 hours of finding that serious injury or threat thereof exists with respect to a domestic industry, to notify the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce of the identity of the industry, the firms within such industry, and the competitive articles produced. Requires the USTR, after receiving an ITC report with an affirmative finding of injurious increased imports, to either: (1) provide import relief (for up to five years) to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to enhance the long-term competitiveness or orderly adjustment to import completion of the industry; or (2) not provide such import relief because of the national security of the United States or the economic costs of providing the relief. Sets forth specified factors the USTR should weigh in making such decisions. Authorizes the USTR to negotiate with concerned governments with respect to the cause of the increase in imports, or to alleviate the serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry. Requires the USTR to submit to the Congress a document describing the import relief provided to an industry. Requires the import relief to be implemented within a specified time unless the USTR decides to negotiate an orderly marketing agreement. Authorizes the USTR to negotiate orderly marketing agreements and, after such agreements take effect, to suspend or terminate any import relief previously provided. Authorizes the USTR to provide other import relief if after being negotiated an orderly marketing agreement does not continue to be effective. Provides for treating as an increase in duty the suspension of: (1) certain tariff provisions with respect to an article; and (2) the designation of any article as eligible for tariff preferences. Prohibits such suspension from being made by the USTR or recommended by the ITC unless specified conditions are met. Sets forth regulatory authority for providing import relief. Provides for the extension, modification, and termination of import relief provisions. Requires the ITC to review, and report annually to the USTR on, developments with respect to an industry receiving import relief so long as such relief remains in effect. Requires the ITC to advise the USTR on the probable economic effect on the industry concerned of the extension, reduction, or termination of the import relief. Prohibits another ITC import relief investigation with respect to an article unless two years have passed since the previous relief was provided. Authorizes the USTR to take import relief actions only after consideration of the relation of such actions to U.S. international obligations. Imposes certain conditions on treating production located in a major geographic area as the "domestic industry" for import relief purposes. Chapter 2: Industry Relief From Market Disruption Caused by Imports From Nonmarket Economy Countries - Transfers from the President to the USTR the authority to take action in response to an ITC finding of market disruption with respect to imports from a non-market economy country (defined as a country in which economic activity is determined through central government planning rather than dependent on market forces). Declares that market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be an important cause of, or threat of, material injury to the competing domestic industry. Sets forth factors the ITC shall consider in determining whether market disruption exists. Authorizes the ITC to recommend, in addition to other relief, a variable tariff that is equivalent to the average of the average domestic producer prices and average import prices. Authorizes the USTR to deny import relief with respect to imports from nonmarket economy countries only if the provision of such relief would have a serious negative impact on the domestic economy. Chapter 3: Trade Adjustment Assistance - Authorizes an adversely affected worker to elect to receive trade readjustment allowances (in the form of supplemental wage allowances) for any week of full-time services if the worker accepts the full-time job at a weekly wage that is less than such worker's average weekly wage in adversely affected employment and such worker has met specified requirements. Sets forth the maximum allowable amount to be paid to a worker. Changes the eligibility requirements with respect to the payment of trade readjustment assistance to authorize the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to waive the requirement that a worker be enrolled in a job search program if the Secretary determines that no acceptable job search program is reasonably available for the worker. Prohibits the payment of assistance to a worker until the worker enrolls or resumes participation in a training program approved by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary, if specified conditions are met, to approve job training and the payment of such training (but not to exceed $4,000) for an adversely affected worker. Requires each cooperating State agency (agency which provides trade adjustment assistance services) to: (1) advise adversely affected workers of training opportunities as soon as practicable (current law requires the agency to provide such advice within 60 days of receiving an application for training); (2) advise each worker applying for unemployment insurance of the benefits under the Trade Act of 1974; and (3) facilitate the early filing of petitions for eligibility for trade adjustment assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants and loans (not to exceed $1,000,000 each at any given time) for job training programs administered by educational institutions and by firms for eligible workers. Establishes the Supplemental Training Fund for the provision of such job training programs. Changes the eligibility requirements with respect to payment of trade adjustment assistance by requiring the Secretary of Labor to automatically certify any group of workers or firm that is within a domestic industry in which the Secretary receives specified notification and that produces articles that are like or directly competitive with the articles identified in such notification if the petition for certification for such assistance is filed within three years of notification. Establishes the Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund. Provides for the funding of the Trust Fund. Directs the President to undertake negotiations to change the GATT to allow countries to impose a small uniform duty on all imports in order to use the revenue from such duty to fund trade adjustment assistance programs. Directs the President to report to the Congress as soon as the GATT allows the imposition of such a duty. Imposes an additional duty on all imports into the United States, including those imports granted duty-free treatment, with specified exceptions. Subtitle D: Relief From Injury Caused by Subsidies and Dumping - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that certain producers of raw agricultural products may be considered part of the industry producing processed agricultural products for purposes of bringing countervailing and antidumping duty complaints. Sets forth the criteria such producers must meet. Defines "material injury" for purposes of complaints involving imports of a raw agricultural product and products processed from such raw agricultural product. Classifies a coalition or trade association which represents either processors or processors and producers or growers as interested parties in such investigations. Requires the administering authority to determine in each antidumping and countervailing duty investigation whether benefits under a foreign subsidy are actually paid on a specific foreign enterprise or industry. Sets forth provisions, for purposes of defining "subsidy," with respect to the administering authority's determination of whether foreign goods or services are provided at preferential rates. Permits the ITC, in determining whether material injury occurred in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to consider such other economic factors as are relevant. Requires the ITC, in determining whether material injury occurred in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to assess cumulatively the volume and price effects of imports from two or more countries if such imports compete with each other and with like products of the domestic industry in the U.S. market and if such imports: (1) are subject to any antidumping or countervailing duty investigation; (2) during the preceding 12 months were subjected to a final order or suspension agreement; or (3) were entered before any quantitative restraint was imposed. Permits the ITC, in determining whether material injury, or the threat of material injury to a domestic industry, or the material retardation of the establishment of a domestic industry, to consider whether imports of the merchandise which is the subject of an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation have historically supplied a substantial proportion of demand in a geographically isolated market, and, if appropriate, to disregard the imports into such geographically isolated market in making such determination. Requires the ITC, in determining whether a domestic industry is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of merchandise, to consider, among other relevant economic factors, the extent to which the United States is a focal point for exports of the merchandise by reason of restraints on exports of the merchandise to, or on imports of the merchandise into, third country markets. Requires the ITC, in determining whether a domestic industry is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of merchandise, to assess cumulatively the volume and price effects of imports from two or more countries if such imports: (1) compete with each other, and with like products of the domestic industry; and (2) are subject to any antidumping or countervailing duty investigation. Requires the ITC to consider whether dumping in third-country markets suggests a threat of material injury to a domestic industry with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases. Sets forth provisions relating to preventing the circumvention of countervailing antidumping duty orders and findings. Outlines considerations with respect to the applicability of such orders and findings for: (1) products completed or assembled in the United States with parts or components imported from a country covered by such an order or finding; (2) products completed or assembled in a third country prior to importation into the United States; (3) products altered to be removed from a particular tariff classification; and (4) determining whether a later-developed product is subject to an outstanding order or finding. Requires the administering authority to investigate whether diversionary input dumping is occurring whenever: (1) the administering authority has reasonable grounds to suspect that such dumping is occurring; (2) a specified type of material or component is routinely used as a major material or component in manufacturing or producing the merchandise under investigation; and (3) generally accepted trade statistics indicate that, after the issuance of an antidumping duty order or the entry into force of an international agreement relating to the importation into the United States of such material or component, the quantity or market share of shipments to the United States has decreased and shipments to the United States of the merchandise under investigation have increased. Sets forth the timetable for preliminary and final determinations by the administering authority as to the existence of diversionary input dumping. Provides that the foreign market value of merchandise that constitutes diversionary input dumping shall be the constructed value of the merchandise. Provides for increasing the cost of the material or component that is found to be involved in diversionary input dumping. Applies countervailing duty provisions to non-market economy countries. Changes the limits imposed on access to business proprietary information obtained by the administering authority. Requires the administering authority or the ITC to make all such information available under protective order. Imposes a 14-day deadline for determining whether to release such information. Imposes certain other requirements on service of such information, notification of the submission of such information, and timely submissions. Prohibits antidumping and countervailing duties from being treated as regular customs duties for drawback purposes. Provides that merchandise imported by or for the use of Federal agencies is not exempt from the imposition of countervailing or antidumping duties. Requires persons making submissions to the administering authority or the ITC in antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings to certify that such submission is accurate and complete to the best of that person's knowledge. Sets forth provisions relating to antidumping and countervailing duty determinations with respect to: (1) deviations from administrative precedent; (2) correction of ministerial errors; and (3) administrative review. Authorizes a domestic producer of an article that is like a component part or a downstream product to petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring by the ITC. Sets forth information to be included in the petition. Requires the administering authority to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion with respect to component parts. Sets forth factors the administering authority may take into account in making such determination. Requires the ITC to make quarterly reports to the administering authority regarding the ITC monitoring of a downstream product. Requires the administering authority to review the reports of the ITC and: (1) consider such information in determining whether to initiate an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation regarding a downstream product; and (2) request the ITC to cease its monitoring if the information indicates that imports are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion with respect to component parts. Authorizes an eligible domestic entity to file a petition with the Secretary of Commerce requesting that a product monitoring category be established with respect to dumping of products into the United States by foreign countries. Sets forth information to be included in the petition. Requires the ITC to establish a product monitoring category within 90 days. Permits, after a product monitoring category is established, a domestic entity to request the Secretary of Commerce to monitor the importation of any product that: (1) is included in that category; and (2) is produced by any first offender with respect to such category. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, after a product monitoring category is established, to monitor the importation of products within the category that are produced by each second and multiple offender. Provides for the recovery of damages with respect to such dumping. Requires the administering authority to notify the ITC whenever U.S. international obligations require a determination of injury to a domestic industry with respect to merchandise that is covered by a countervailing duty order for which there was no determination of injury by the ITC. Requires the ITC, within 180 days after the date of such notice, to make a determination of whether a U.S. industry would be materially injured or would be threatened with material injury or the establishment of an industry would be materially retarded by imports of duty-free merchandise that is subject to an outstanding countervailing duty order if such order were revoked. Suspends, pending the ITC's determination, the liquidation of entries covered by such order and which are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of the injury requirement notice. Requires the administering authority, upon an affirmative determination by the ITC, to liquidate the entries of merchandise that were suspended and continue suspension of liquidation and the collection of estimated duties required to be deposited. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to undertake a study of the new market orientation of China. Requires such study to address, but not be limited to, the: (1) effect of the new orientation on Chinese market policies and price structure; (2) extent to which U.S. trade law practices can accomodate the increased market orientation of the Chinese economy; and (3) possible need for changes in U.S. antidumping laws as they apply to China. Requires the USTR to review bilateral subsidy commitments entered into by foreign countries with the United States. Requires the USTR to submit a report on such review to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Subtitle E: Intellectual Property Rights - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to make unlawful the unauthorized importation or unauthorized sale within the United States after importation of articles that: (1) infringe a valid and enforceable U.S. patent or copyright; or (2) are made under, or by means of, a patented process. Makes it unlawful to import or sell within the United States after importation articles that infringe a valid and enforceable U.S. trademark.

Authorizes the ITC to terminate an investigation by issuing a consent order or on the basis of a settlement agreement. Requires the ITC to make a determination with regard to a petition alleging unfair import practices within 90 days (150 days in more complicated cases) of the publication of notice of the investigation. Authorizes the ITC to grant preliminary relief with respect to violations involving intellectual property to the same extent as unauthorized under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Requires the ITC to refer violations involving intellectual property rights to the USTR. (Currently, the President.) Authorizes the ITC to issue cease and desist orders in addition to exclusion orders. Imposes the burden of proof on the petitioner in cases where the petitioner has previously been found in violation of the provision prohibiting unfair import practices and the petitioner is asking the ITC: (1) to find that the petitioner is no longer violating the section; or (2) for a modification or rescission of the penalty imposed on such petitioner. Sets forth the grounds for granting such relief. Prohibits disclosure (except to certain ITC and Customs Service employees) of confidential information submitted to the ITC unless the petitioner consents to disclosure. Requires the USTR to identify those countries: (1) that have the most egregious acts, policies, or practices that deny such protection and have the greatest adverse impact in their own markets, or in other international markets, for the affected U.S. items; and (2) that have not entered into good faith negotiations to provide adequate protection of such rights. Requires the USTR, after a country has been identified, to initiate an unfair practices investigation. Subtitle F: Organization and Functions of Trade Agencies - Chapter 1: Office of the United States Trade Representative - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to set forth the functions of the USTR. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the USTR should be: (1) the senior representative on any body that the President may establish to provide him with advice on economic policies in which international trade matters predominate; and (2) included as a participant in all international trade summits and meetings. Establishes the Office of Unfair Trade Practices (Office) in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Sets forth the functions of the Office. Transfers from the President to the USTR authority to provide benefits to a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences. Requires the USTR, not later than the date that the USTR must submit national trade estimates to specified congressional committees, to identify and analyze any other significant act, policy, or practice that may constitute an element of export targeting by a foreign country. Chapter 2: United States International Trade Commission - Requires the ITC to conduct annual studies regarding: (1) the conditions of U.S. completion and global markets; (2) the implications of such conditions of competition for U.S. national economic security; and (3) the extent to which recent U.S. actions under the trade laws have affected the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Requires the ITC to monitor those imports that may pose problems from import competition for U.S. industries. Requires the Trade Remedy Assistance Office, in coordination with each agency responsible for administering a trade law, to provide technical and legal assistance to eligible small businesses to enable them to: (1) prepare and file petitions and applications; and (2) obtain remedies and benefits under the U.S. trade laws, including administrative review or appeal. Designates the ITC an independent regulatory agency for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (allowing the ITC to override disapproval by the Office of Management and Budget of the issuance of a questionnaire to members of the public). Subtitle G: Miscellaneous Trade Law Provisions - Amends the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require the Secretary of Commerce to report, within 270 days the Secretary's findings on the effects on national security of certain imports. Requires the President, within 90 days if the Secretary of Commerce finds that imports of an article are threatening national security, to: (1) determine whether the President concurs with the Secretary; (2) if the President concurs, determine what action to take; and (3) report to the Congress on such determination. Requires the President to take action with 15 days of determining to take action to adjust such imports. Provides for the enforcement of an agreement relating to machine tool imports. Authorizes the President, with respect to the eligibility of an article for benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, to designate as eligible for such benefits watches the USTR determines will not cause material injury to watch manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or U.S. possessions. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President, after January 4, 1987, to waive the competitive need limits with respect to a country eligible for preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences if that country: (1) qualifies for a waiver under specified criteria; (2) is a debtor country having difficulty servicing its debt; and (3) has not less than 20 percent of its debt held by any combination of U.S. banks, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Sets forth a formula for allocating such benefits. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act should be preserved; (2) any changes should not unduly affect the unilateral duty free trade system available to the beneficiary countries designated under such Act; (3) any generic changes in the trade laws should not discriminate against imports from such beneficiary countries in relation to imports from other U.S. trading partners; and (4) the United States should maintain the commitment made by such Act to the countries of the Western Hemisphere which is in the economic and security interest of the United States. Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to permit (currently requires) the President, after complying with specified requirements, to withdraw or suspend the designation of a country as a beneficiary country, or withdraw, suspend, or limit duty-free treatment to articles of a foreign country if, he determines that as a result of changed circumstances such country would be barred from designation as a beneficiary country. Amends the International Coffee Agreement Act of 1980 to extend the effective period of such Act until October 1, 1989. Amends the Steel Import Stabilization Act to provide that any steel product that is manufactured in a country that is not party to a bilateral arrangement (a non-arrangement country) from steel which is melted and poured in a country that is an arrangement country will be treated for purposes of the quantitative restrictions under that arrangement as if it were a product of an arrangement country. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should direct the USTR to negotiate an agreement with Japan that calls for Japan to import U.S. metallurgical coal on a market share basis equivalent to Japan's market share of steel products that are exported to the United States. Directs the President to negotiate trade agreements with each country from which 50,000 or more automobiles are imported into the United States each year that will eliminate unfair, restrictive, or discriminatory practices in the marine transportation of such imports. Declares that the Congress: (1) supports efforts by U.S. negotiators to expand opportunities for U.S. automotive parts producers to supply automotive parts for Japanese automobiles; and (2) determines that success of the MOSS talks depends on an increase in sales by U.S. auto parts companies to Japanese vehicle companies. Title II: International Trade in Telecommunications Products and Services - Telecommunications Trade Act of 1987 - Sets forth the findings and purposes of this Act. Declares that the primary U.S. negotiating objectives regarding telecommunications products and services are to provide for: (1) the nondiscriminatory procurement of such products and services by foreign government-controlled entities that provide local exchange telecommunications services; (2) assurances that registration requirements for customer premises products be limited to a manufacturer's certification that the products meet certain safety standards; (3) openness in the standards-setting processes used in foreign countries; (4) the ability to have customer premises products approved and registered by type and mutual recognition of type approvals; (5) access to the basic telecommunications network in foreign countries on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms for the provision of value-added services by U.S. suppliers; and (6) monitoring and effective dispute settlement provisions regarding the above issues. Sets forth seven secondary U.S. negotiating objectives. Requires the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and specified interagency trade organizations, to investigate each foreign country in order to: (1) identify and analyze those trade policies and practices that deny fully competitive market opportunities to U.S. telecommunications firms; and (2) establish specific primary and secondary negotiating objectives.
