  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits Amendments of 1986 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to increase from $50,000 to $100,000 the benefits paid to survivors of public safety officers (law enforcement officers and fire fighters) who died as a result of injury sustained in the line of duty. Eliminates the requirement that a parent (or parents) be a dependent (or dependents) of such officer in order to be an alternate beneficiary. Directs the Bureau of Justice Assistance to adjust public safety officer death benefits to reflect the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. Makes the date of death the determining date regarding the death benefit amount payable to beneficiaries. Establishes the Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits Trust Fund in the Treasury. Requires each convicted felon to pay $500 into the court registry for deposit into such Fund.</summary>
