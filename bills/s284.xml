National Security Trade Act of 1987 - Amends the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to grant the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) the responsibility for investigating, upon request, the effects of imports on national security. Requires the Secretary to report to the President on such investigation within six months of receiving the request that starts the investigation. Requires the Secretary to notify the Secretary of Defense concerning any such investigation. Requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a separate defense needs assessment of the article affected by such imports. Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Secretary on such assessment within three months. Requires the Secretary's report to the President on such investigation to include a statement by the Secretary of Defense concurring or disagreeing with the Secretary's findings and explaining such concurrence or disagreement. Requires any portion of such report to be published if it is not: (1) classified as being clearly detrimental to the national security; and (2) proprietary information as defined in this Act. Requires the President to : (1) decide whether or not to take action based on such report within 90 days of receiving it; and (2) explain the decision to take action or not to take action on the report submitted to the President by the Secretary. Sets forth actions the President may take to provide protection from the effects of imports on the national security, including: (1) imposing import restrictions or duties against the countries generating the imports that threaten to impair the national security; or (2) negotiating an agreement that imposes limits on such imports. Requires the President, if the President attempts to negotiate such an agreement and the agreement is not completed within six months or the agreement is ineffective, to take other actions to adjust imports. Requires the President to publish an explanation if the agreement is ineffective or is not entered into within six months and the President decides not to take other remedial action.</summary>
