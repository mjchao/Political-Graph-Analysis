Sets forth requirements for the use of funds made available for such projects. Requires the annual report to the Congress on foreign aid programs to include a report on the implementation of this Act. Directs the Administrator of AID to study and report to the Congress within five years of enactment of this Act on the projects funded pursuant to this Act and their effectiveness in preventing famine. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 to carry out this Act.</summary>
