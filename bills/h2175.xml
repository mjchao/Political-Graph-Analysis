  <summary>4/27/1987--Introduced.
Suspends most-favored-nation treatment for Romania products for six months. Requires the President, not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act and every 60 days thereafter, to submit to the Congress a detailed report on the human rights situation in Romania, including an assessment of whether free emigration continues to be denied and the degree to which it persecutes its citizens on religious and political grounds. Requires the President to submit such reports whether or not most-favored-nation treatment is restored to Romanian products after the six-month suspension period. Requires the President's next report to the Congress following the six-month suspension to contain an assessment as to whether restoration of most-favored-nation treatment to Romanian products will improve the human rights situation in that country if he exercises his authority under the Trade Act of 1974 to make such restoration.</summary>
