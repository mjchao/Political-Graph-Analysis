  <summary>2/1/1988--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, S. Rept. 100-280) Retail Competition Enforcement Act of 1987 - Amends the Sherman Act to set forth evidentiary standards for price-fixing actions. Requires the court to allow the issue of concerted action to fix prices to be decided by the trier of fact if there is sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that: (1) the supplier of a good or service received from a competitor of a reseller an express or implied suggestion, request, or demand that the supplier take steps to curtail or eliminate price competition; and (2) sales or supplies to the reseller were terminated by the supplier because of such communication. Provides that the fact that a supplier and a reseller entered into an agreement to establish the resale price of a good or service shall be sufficient to constitute a price fixing violation.</summary>
