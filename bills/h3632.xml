  <summary>11/10/1987--Introduced.
Acid Deposition Control Act of 1987 - Title I: Stationary Sources - Amends the Clean Air Act to require each Governor to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for approval a two-phased plan establishing emission limitations and compliance schedules for sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions from fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units in the State. Requires reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions by 1994 (phase I) and reductions in oxides of nitrogen and further reductions in sulfur dioxide by 1999 (phase II). Directs each Governor to submit to the Administrator for approval an emissions limitations plan for such units, other than electric utilities' units, requiring both sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions reductions by 1999. Requires the Administrator to identify the total statewide potential reductions in such emissions and to transmit such information to the State. Requires each Governor to submit to the Administrator a plan for establishing emission limitations from stationary sources of industrial process emissions to achieve such State's potential reductions by 1999. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress by June 30, 1994, on the reductions achieved during phase II, granting the Congress an opportunity to legislate by the start of 1995 against the implementation of phase II. Grants States an opportunity to modify disapproved plans. Establishes emissions standards and Administrator-promulgated plans for States without an approved plan. Requires units in such States to submit a compliance plan and schedule to the Administrator. Sets forth emission reduction alternatives for use in addition to enforceable continuous emission reduction standards. Terminates exemptions for primary nonferrous smelter emissions. Requires the Administrator to revise oxides of nitrogen emissions standards for new units. Directs the Secretary of Energy to give priority assistance to clean coal technology projects with the greatest and most cost-effective emissions reduction potential.</summary>
