  <summary>4/1/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to apply country-of-origin marking requirements to imported articles of fresh fruit and vegetables if they are removed from a container subject to such a requirement. Requires, for such articles offered for sale individually, that a sign indicating the name of the country of origin be placed at the bin or area where such articles are offered for retail sale. Requires, for such articles repackaged for sale, that either each package be marked with an indication of the country of origin or a sign giving that information be affixed to the bin or other area where the packages are offered for sale. Makes any fresh vegetable or fruit sold in violation of these requirements subject to seizure and forfeiture. Imposes penalties of $1,000 for the first violation and $5,000 for each subsequent violation of this Act.</summary>
