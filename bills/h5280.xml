(House agreed to Senate amendments with amendments) Bicentennial of the United States Congress Commemorative Coin Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue not more than a specified number of five dollar gold coins, one dollar silver coins, and half dollar clad coins emblematic of the Bicentennial of the U.S. Congress. Sets forth certain features of such coins. Mandates that the coin design be selected by the Secretary after consultation with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Commission of Fine Arts. Provides for the issuance and sale of the coins. Terminates their minting after June 30, 1990. Requires the Secretary to deposit all surcharges received from the sale of such coins, in specified portions, in: (1) the Capitol Preservation Fund, to be available to the United States Capitol Preservation Commission; and (2) the Treasury, to reduce the national debt. Declares that no law governing procurement or public contracts is applicable to the procurement of goods and services for carrying out this Act, except that this provision does not relieve any person from complying with any law relating to equal employment opportunity.</summary>
