  <summary>3/18/1987--Introduced.
Reciprocal Motor Vehicle Safety Certification Act of 1987 - Amends the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 to detail the information necessary from foreign motor vehicle manufacturers seeking certification that their vehicles conform with Federal safety standards. States that such certification must be accompanied by a manufacturer's declaration that the vehicle's country of orgin accepts U.S. certification for imported American vehicles that the vehicles conform to corresponding safety standards, without further testing, inspection, or reporting requirements; and that no greater regulatory burden is imposed than under Federal law. Allows the Secretary of Transportation, absent such a declaration, to verify safety standard conformance and recover costs of such determinations through fees. Applies such requirements only to vehicles manufactured or assembled outside of the United States in a country for which the Secretary determines there were 350,000 or more new motor vehicles produced and introduced for sale in interstate commerce during calendar year 1984. States that verification by the Secretary shall not be required if the Secretary finds that the burdens of such verification requirement upon the United States and U.S. manufacturers outweigh the benefits of access to the motor vehicle market of the other country by U.S. manufacturers. Makes the safety certification requirement inapplicable in any model year to foreign motor vehicles if the Secretary finds that the potential U.S. market for such model will not be substantial.</summary>
