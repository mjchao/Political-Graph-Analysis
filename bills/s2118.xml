  <summary>3/2/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit the imposition of excise tax on the sale of diesel fuel to any purchaser (or purchaser for resale to a second purchaser) for any use not as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or a diesel-powered train. (Although fuel sold for such off-highway uses is tax-exempt under current law, provisions of the Revenue Act of 1987 require purchasers to pay the tax and subsequently apply for a refund based on the nontaxable use.)</summary>
