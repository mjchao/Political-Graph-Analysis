  <summary>10/14/1988--Introduced.
Authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain lands designated as the Carolina Sandhills Wildlife Management Area to the South Carolina Commission of Forestry. Conditions such transfer upon the Commission: (1) managing such lands for the benefit of endangered species of plants or animals in accordance with the Recovery Plan for the Red Cockaded Woodpecker; (2) consulting with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the impact of its management practices on such endangered species; and (3) entering into an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to provide to such lands basic forest fire protection and certain burning and reforestation services for specified periods of time after the date of such transfer. Provides that such lands shall revert to the United States if: (1) the Secretary determines that the Commission is not in compliance with the terms of such transfer; (2) the lands cease to be used for public purposes; or (3) the Commission no longer desires to operate such lands. Authorizes the Commission to acquire lands within or adjacent to the transferred lands by exchange or sale of such land. Provides that the Commission, prior to such acquisition, shall: (1) notify the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and (2) determine that the acquisition is in the best interest of the public purposes of South Carolina and is necessary for efficient management administration of the transferred lands. Repeals a certain executive order concerning the Sand Hills State Forest.</summary>
