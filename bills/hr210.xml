  <summary>6/24/1987--Introduced.
Amends rule XXI of Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit any appropriation from being reported in any joint resolution continuing appropriations, or from being in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law, except to continue appropriations for public works and objects which are already in progress. Prohibits any provision which changes existing laws from being reported in any joint resolution continuing appropriations except germane provisions which retrench expenditures by the reduction of money covered by the bill, which may include those recommended to the Committee on Appropriations by direction of any legislative committee having jurisdiction over the subject matter. Prohibits an amendment to a joint resolution continuing appropriations from being in order if changing existing law. Declares that, except as provided by this Act, no amendment shall be in order during consideration of a joint resolution continuing appropriations proposing a limitation not specifically contained or authorized in existing law for the period of the limitation. Sets forth floor procedure for consideration of an acceptable joint resolution continuing appropriations. Prohibits the House from considering any joint resolution continuing appropriations, or amendments thereto, which covers a period of more than 90 calendar days. Prohibits any item of appropriation set forth in any joint resolution continuing appropriations from exceeding the lesser of the amount set forth for such item in the House-passed or Senate-passed general appropriation bill for the fiscal year. Declares that if there is no House-passed or Senate-passed bill containing such item, then such item shall be at the rate at which it would have been assuming the continuation of current law. Prohibits the waiver of any provision of this resolution except by two-thirds vote of the Members present and voting. Declares this resolution applicable with respect to joint resolutions continuing appropriations for FY 1989 or any subsequent fiscal year.</summary>
