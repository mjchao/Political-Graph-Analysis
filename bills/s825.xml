(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 - Title I: Housing Assistance - Subtitle A: Programs Under United States Housing Act of 1937 - Part I: General Provisions - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to increase FY 1988 and 1989 budget authority for lower income housing programs. Sets forth FY 1988 and 1989 budget amounts for the following programs: (1) public housing, including Indian housing; (2) comprehensive improvement assistance program; (3) elderly and handicapped program; (4) moderate rehabilitation program; (5) loan management program; (6) property disposition program; and (7) section 8 certificate and voucher programs. Permits public housing agencies (PHAs) to establish three-year rent limitations. Exempts housing administered by an Indian PHA from such provision. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress by October 30, 1988, regarding public housing utility allowances. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to establish different income eligibility limitations for different assisted housing programs, provided that such limitations when aggregated achieve the requirement that 95 percent of such housing go to very low-income households. Waives such aggregate percentage: (1) if necessary to avoid rental displacement; and (2) with regard to Indian housing. Part 2: Public Housing - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize PHAs to admit persons between 50 years old and 62 years old (near elderly) into elderly public housing when there is an insufficient number of elderly persons for such units. Authorizes grants for public housing and Indian housing construction and development. Limits, as of October 1, 1987, the financing of new public housing units to PHAs that can certify: (1) that 85 percent of their existing units are maintained in compliance with section 8 quality standards, or will be in such condition upon completion; (2) that the construction will replace disposed of or demolished units, or is required by court order or by the Secretary; and (3) that demands for family housing exceed rental assistance program capacity. Prohibits the Secretary from recapturing public housing reservation funds for 30 months following the date of reservation, due to the failure of a PHA to complete acquisition and begin construction or rehabilitation. Permits a PHA to make site or project changes during such period as long as such changes will not result in fewer units acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated. Extends such period for delays caused by: (1) the Secretary; (2) environmental review; (3) legal action; or (4) factors beyond the PHA's control. Prohibits the Secretary from using as a criterion for distributing public housing development funds an Indian PHA's rent collection improvement, unless it is one of several other selection criteria. Authorizes Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA determines such housing is needed. Authorizes grants for public housing child care. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within three years of enactment of this Act. Authorizes FY 1988 and 1989 appropriations.

Permits public housing residents to form resident management corporations. Requires such corporations to obtain fidelity bonding and insurance and have their records audited annually. Authorizes such projects to receive comprehensive improvement assistance. Provides for: (1) retention of excess revenues; and (2) resident management technical assistance and training.

Requires, as conditions for resident ownership, that: (1) a resident management corporation be formed; (2) the corporation has entered into a contract with the PHA; and (3) the corporation has demonstrated its managerial ability for at least three years. Authorizes the Secretary to provide comprehensive improvement assistance to a project undergoing resident ownership activities through FY 1989. Sets forth purchase conditions, including: (1) PHA public hearings; (2) safety and livability determinations; and (3) PHA certification of sold unit replacement if justified by local low-income housing needs. Sets forth resale conditions, including: (1) permitted resale only to the resident management corporation, PHA, or other eligible low-income family; and (2) family priorities. Requires that sale or recapture proceeds be used only to increase the number of available units. Permits PHA financing if no other source is available. Sets the interest rate at not less than 70 percent of the conventional mortgage rate. Requires HUD to continue to pay annual assistance to the project. Eliminates operating subsidies for a purchased building. Sets forth the following protection for nonpurchasing families: (1) eviction prohibition; (2) tenants' rights; and (3) rental and relocation assistance.

Establishes a public housing comprehensive transition demonstration program in Charlotte, North Carolina (authorizes up to ten additional program sites) to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing comprehensive services to public housing tenants to ensure their transition to private housing. Sets up such program with a two-year remediation phase and a five-year transition phase (including a full-time employment requirement). Requires the Secretary to submit an interim and final report to the Congress. Terminates such program seven years after enactment of this Act. Part 3: Section 8 Assistance and Other Programs - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require section 8 annual contribution contracts for existing housing to provide for a specific number of certificates and vouchers over a specified period.

Authorizes the Secretary to set aside up to five percent of authorized voucher funds for an annual adjustment pool to be used to maintain continued housing affordability.

Sets rehabilitation grant limits at: (1) $5,000 per efficiency unit; (2) $6,500 for one bedroom units; (3) $7,500 for two bedroom units; and (4) $8,500 for three or more bedroom units. Permits such grants to be used for seismic standards compliance where applicable. States that development grant eligibility requirements shall be those that were in effect as of October 17, 1986. Terminates the rental development grant program as of October 1, 1989. Subtitle B: Other Housing Assistance Programs - Amends the Housing Act of 1959 to authorize FY 1988 and 1989 appropriations for elderly and handicapped housing loans. Bases interest rates on the most recently issued 30-year Treasury obligations.

Gives loan priority through FY 1988 to projects providing replacement housing for 100-unit or more projects used for the elderly and scheduled for demolition.

Grants to State and local governments the right of first refusal with respect to HUD-owned multifamily projects when HUD receives a bona fide purchase offer. Applies displacement protection to tenants of multifamily projects controlled by HUD (current provisions cover only HUD-owned projects). Requires owners of non-HUD projects to provide the same protections. Limits HUD authority to approve the sale of certain projects, loans, and mortgages. Permits negotiated sales of subsidized or formerly subsidized mortgages to agencies of State and local government. Requires the Secretary to consider as a factor in determining bids on multifamily housing projects the goal of preserving low-income housing. Broadens specified assisted housing tenant participation provisions. Establishes a three-year program to demonstrate the effectiveness of disposing of HUD-owned distressed multifamily housing projects through a partnership with State housing finance agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to make direct loans to assist onwers of multifamily housing in making capital improvements to maintain the projects as decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Establishes in the Treasury a Flexible Subsidy Fund, a revolving fund to finance operating assistance for troubled multifamily housing projects, including capital improvement aid.
