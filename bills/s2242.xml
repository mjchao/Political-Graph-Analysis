  <summary>3/31/1988--Introduced.
Free Postal Delivery Protection Act of 1988 - Amends Federal law to require the Postal Service to: (1) provide for and maintain a delivery service for the free delivery of mail to the greatest extent possible; and (2) maintain a six-day mail delivery schedule in all areas to the greatest extent possible, keeping the minimum delivery level of such schedules at the FY 1983 level. Requires the Postal Service, when determining whether to close or consolidate a post office, to consider whether closing or consolidation may substantially change the character and nature of delivery relative to delivery service for other post offices in the same Postal Service division. Requires the Postal Service to include proposed alternatives for service in any determination to close or consolidate a post office.</summary>
