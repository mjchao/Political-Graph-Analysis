Requires the Commissioner of Customs to enforce this provision. Requires the Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service to study annually the impact that the availability of undersized lobsters is having on the implementation of the fishery management plan. Requires transmittal of the study results to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.</summary>
