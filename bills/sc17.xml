Declares that the American people reaffirm our commitment to promote the development of democracy for all Korean people. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the U.S. interest in securing democracy and human rights in the Republic of Korea would be best served by the peaceful establishment of democratic institutions; (2) a necessary condition for achieving democracy is an electoral system that gives the Korean people confidence that the outcome of such elections will reflect their will; and (3) the necessary conditions of such elections are freedom of expression, freedom of the press, due process of law, an independent judiciary, an end to the use of torture, the release of all political prisoners, and the restoration of full political and civil rights.</summary>
