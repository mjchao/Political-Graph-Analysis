Retains in the Treasury specified sums appropriated previously and in this Act for the design and construction of such a prison, pending certain conditions.

Allots a certain amount of funding for public safety and justice to reimburse Fairfax and Prince William Counties in Virginia for expenses incurred during FY 1988 relating to the Lorton prison complex. Directs the Mayor to reduce energy appropriations and expenditures by a specified sum. Sets forth restrictions on the expenditure of appropriations made by this Act. Makes funds available for: (1) transportation allowances for official duties; (2) travel expenses and the payment of dues for organizations concerned with the work of the District of Columbia government; (3) refunds and the payment of judgments entered against the District of Columbia government; (4) the payment of public assistance; (5) the cost of overtime or temporary positions; and (6) payments authorized by the District of Columbia Revenue Recovery Act of 1977.
