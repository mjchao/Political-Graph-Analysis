Regulatory Oversight and Control Act of 1987 - Title I: Agency Rulemaking Improvements - Requires each executive agency and each independent regulatory agency to include in the notice of a proposed rule an explanation of the agency's determination as to whether the rule is a major rule. Directs each agency, before or upon publishing notice of a proposed rulemaking proceeding for a major rule, to issue statements concerning: (1) the need for the rule; (2) the reasonable alternative approaches; (3) regional differences; (4) the benefits, costs, and effectiveness of the proposed rule and alternatives; (5) the advantages and disadvantages of adopting performance standards rather than design standards; (6) the technical information the agency will rely on in making the rule; and (7) the statutory authority of the agency to regulate any areas previously regulated only by State law. Requires that each agency issue additional statements upon providing notice of the promulgation of a major rule, including a statement of its determination that the benefits of the rule will justify the costs of the rule and that the rule will achieve rulemaking objectives in a more cost effective manner than the alternatives. Directs each agency to: (1) include in the notice of each proposed and final major rule instructions on how the public may obtain copies of agency statements on such rule; (2) send a copy of all statements required at the notice and publication of a major rule to the President; and (3) include such statements and any technical information considered in the rulemaking file. Requires agencies to provide for oral presentations at informal public hearings as part of the rulemaking proceedings for major rules. Directs agencies to allow cross-examination of persons presenting information if necessary to resolve significant issues of fact. Directs agencies to regulate such public hearings so as to ensure orderly and expeditious proceedings. Allows an agency to delay completing the rulemaking requirements of this Act if it publishes a finding that complying with such requirements before making the rule would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Requires an agency to complete such requirements as soon as practicable after promulgating the rule unless the rule will expire within two years. Sets forth provisions governing the judicial review of agency compliance with rulemaking and rule review requirements of this Act and the President's compliance with oversight requirements. Directs the President to: (1) establish procedures for agency implementation of the requirements of this title; (2) afford the public an opportunity to comment on such procedures before adoption; and (3) monitor, review, and comment on agency compliance with such requirements. Permits the Comptroller General to review agency compliance with this Act. Requires each agency to publish in the Federal Register, semiannually, a regulatory agenda containing a list of all rules the agency expects to propose, promulgate, repeal, modify, or review in the next year and specified information concerning such rules. Requires publication of the agendas of all agencies in a single issue of the Federal Register. Directs each agency to publish for public comment a proposed schedule for the review of its existing major rules and other rules that may be added by the agency or the President. Declares that each such rule shall cease to be effective not more than ten years after the date the final schedule is published. Directs each agency to publish its responses to public comments upon publishing the final schedule. Requires an agency to include with the publication of a major rule the date, within ten years, on which the rule will expire and the date by which the rule must be reviewed. Directs each agency to: (1) publish a notice of the initiation of the review of a rule; (2) describe the costs, benefits, problems, and alternatives to the rule; (3) provide a period for public comment; and either (4) conduct a rulemaking proceeding to reissue or amend the rule; or (5) publish an explanation of its decision to allow the rule to expire. Allows agencies to alter review schedules if the President agrees. Eliminates the exemption of rules concerning loans, grants, and benefits from notice and comment rulemaking requirements. Requires that the notice of a proposed rulemaking include: (1) a statement of the objectives of the rule; (2) a statement that the agency seeks proposals from the public of alternative methods; and (3) a statement of where the file of the rulemaking proceeding may be inspected or how file copies may be obtained. Requires an agency to: (1) provide a period of at least 60 days after publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking for the public to submit comments on a proposed rule; and (2) include the agency's response to such comments in the statement published with the adopted rule. Prohibits an agency from relying on any material of central relevance in a rulemaking if the material is not included in the rulemaking file or the public has not had an opportunity to comment on the material. Directs each agency to maintain a public file on each rulemaking proceeding. Allows an agency to exclude from such file any material relied upon which is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, if a statement of the basis for such exclusion is included. Requires a court reviewing an agency action: (1) not to accord any presumption in favor of or against agency action; (2) in determining questions of law other than statutory jurisdiction, to give the agency's interpretation such weight as it warrants considering the agency's authority under law; (3) in making determinations concerning statutory jurisdiction, to determine whether the action is within the agency's jurisdiction on the basis of the statutory language or other indications of legislative intent; and (4) in determining whether the adoption of a rule is in accordance with law, to consider whether there is substantial support in the rulemaking file for the agency's factual determinations. Declares that when proceedings for review of the same agency action are instituted in two or more courts of appeals within ten days, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall select, by a system of random selection, the court in which the record shall be filed. Authorizes the courts to postpone the effective date of the agency action as necessary to permit designation of the court of record. Prohibits agencies from paying expenses of persons participating or intervening in agency proceedings except as specifically authorized by statute. Title II: Congressional Review of Agency Rules - Requires each agency to transmit a copy of each rule it promulgates to the House of Representatives and the Senate. Declares that such rule shall be considered only as a recommendation of the agency to Congress. Prohibits a major rule from taking effect unless a joint resolution approving the rule is enacted within 90 days. Prohibits a rule other than a major rule from taking effect if a joint resolution disapproving the rule is enacted within 90 days. Prohibits an agency from promulgating a new rule that is substantially the same as a major rule that was not approved or any other rule that was disapproved. Directs the Comptroller General, at the request of a committee of either House which has primary legislative jurisdiction over a rule or on his or her own initiative, to inform such committee as to whether the rule is consistent with the statutory authority under which it was promulgated. Exempts an emergency rule from such congressional review requirements if the agency submits to the appropriate congressional committees a written notice of: (1) its determination that the rule is an emergency rule; (2) the time period (limited to 210 days) during which the rule will be effective; and (3) its intention to issue a final rule, if necessary, when such emergency rule expires. Sets forth House and Senate procedures for the consideration of such resolutions of approval or disapproval. Declares that: (1) congressional inaction on or rejection of a resolution disapproving a rule shall not be deemed an expression of approval of that rule; and (2) enactment of a resolution approving a major rule shall not be construed to create any presumption of validity with respect to such rule and shall not affect the judicial review of such rule. Title III: Regulatory Oversight and Control Amendments to House Rules - Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to establish a Regulatory Review Calendar to which all resolutions for the approval or disapproval of agency rules shall be referred. Provides for the consideration of the resolutions on such Calendar on the first and third Monday and the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. Declares that it shall be in order during the reading of a general appropriation bill to consider any germane amendment proposing a limitation restricting the implementation of an agency rule, other than a major rule, for which a resolution of disapproval has not been considered by the House, or has been passed by the House but not enacted, within the time required under this Act. Requires each standing committee of the House to consider and adopt its oversight plans in a meeting which is open to the public by March 1 of the first session of a Congress. Directs each such committee to: (1) consult with other congressional committees with jurisdiction over the same areas to assure that such areas are reviewed in the same Congress and that there is maximum coordination and cooperation between such committees in conducting such review; (2) give priority to the review of programs under permanent budget or statutory authority; and (3) attempt to ensure that all laws, programs, activities, and agencies within its jurisdiction are reviewed at least once every ten years. Requires each committee to submit its final plans to the Committee on Government Operations which shall report all such plans to the Congress with recommendations to assure the effective coordination of such plans. Authorizes the Speaker of the House, with the approval of the House, to appoint special ad hoc committees to review specific matter within the jurisdiction of two or more standing committees. Requires each committee to include in its biennial report to the House separate sections summarizing the legislative and oversight activities of that committee. Declares that it shall not be in order in the House to consider a primary expense resolution for any committee that has not submitted its oversight plans to the Committee on Government Operations.</summary>
