  <summary>6/8/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #172 (328-78)) Children's Television Act of 1988 - Requires the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe standards for commercial television broadcast licensees that limit the duration of advertising in programs for children to a specified number of minutes per hour. Instructs the FCC to initiate appropriate rulemaking proceedings within 30 days of this Act's enactment and to promulgate the final standards within 150 days of enactment. Authorizes modifications of the standards after January 1, 1993, if FCC review and public comments demonstrate that the public interest would be served by the changes. Directs the FCC, when reviewing any application for a television broadcast license renewal, to consider compliance with these advertising standards, as well as the licensee's programming in connection with the educational and information needs of children.</summary>
