  <summary>11/20/1987--Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment.
(Senate agreed to House amendment with an amendment) Criminal Fine Improvements Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish procedures and mechanisms within the judicial branch for processing fines, restitution, forfeiture of bail bonds or collateral, and assessments. Amends the Federal criminal code to provide a five-year statute of limitations for the payment of special assessments. States that, for the purposes of imposing special assessments, offenses under the Assimilative Crimes Statute shall be considered offenses against the United States. Defines "petty offense" as a Class B misdemeanor, Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction. Sets forth the authorized fine levels for Federal offenses. Allows courts to impose alternative fines (up to twice the gain or loss) where a pecuniary gain or loss results from a criminal offense. States that fine levels set by this Act shall not apply where a substantive provision specifies a lesser fine. Sets forth factors to be considered when determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount and payment of such fines, which include: (1) the defendant's income; (2) any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others; (3) whether restitution is ordered; and (4) the need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains. Requires the court to ensure that a fine or other financial penalty imposed does not impair the defendant's ability to make restitution. States that a judgment which includes a sentence to pay a fine shall be considered a final judgment, notwithstanding the fact that such fine can be modified, corrected, or appealed. Requires any person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary payment to make such payment immediately, unless otherwise provided. Prohibits courts from imposing alternative sentences if a fine is not paid. Describes the responsibility for payment of monetary obligations relating to organizations. Authorizes courts to require security for stayed fines. States that fines are: (1) delinquent if payment is more than 30 days late; and (2) in default if payment is delinquent for more than 90 days. Authorizes the Court, upon the petition of the Government, to remit or modify the payment of fines or special assessments if reasonable efforts to collect such fines or assessments are not likely to be effective. Establishes interim and permanent procedures for the receipt of fines and assessments. Sets forth procedures for computing: (1) the interest on fines; and (2) penalties for delinquent fines.</summary>
