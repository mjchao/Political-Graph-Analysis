  <summary>10/14/1988--Introduced.
Resolves that: (1) the Congress should decide whether the Bell operating companies should be permitted to provide information services, conduct research, design and market software, and design, manufacture, and market telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment; and (2) statutory safeguards should be in place both to ensure that these Bell activities would not harm telephone service customers or competition in the information services or manufacturing industries and to prevent cross subsidies between regulated and unregulated service offerings.</summary>
