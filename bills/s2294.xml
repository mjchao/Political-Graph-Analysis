  <summary>4/18/1988--Introduced.
Veterans' Administration Health Care Amendments Act of 1988 - Repeals current Federal veterans' provisions which: (1) prohibit the Administrator of Veterans Affairs from furnishing treatment and rehabilitation for alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disabilities of veterans after September 30, 1988; and (2) direct the Administrator to monitor the performance of each contract facility performing the above care and services for veterans for quality assurance and cost-effectiveness purposes. Extends through FY 1991 the Veterans Administration's (VA) authority to provide respite care services. Provides that the VA has the authority to pay for emergency medical services for veterans participating in a vocational rehabilitation program when the veteran cannot reasonably obtain medical care through VA or other Government facilities. Extends through FY 1994 the authority of the President to authorize the Administrator to contract with the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) in the Republic of the Philippines to provide for payments for care in the VMMC for eligible U.S. veterans. Extends through FY 1994 the authority of the Administrator to make grants of up to $500,000 annually to the VMMC for education and training of health service personnel and for equipment upgrading and replacement. Increases the per diem rates to be paid to States for the care of veterans in State homes. Deletes the specific listing of professions eligible for the VA Health Professional Scholarship program, instead making eligible for such program any person engaged in a field of training or study in direct health-care services. Defines the period of obligated service for those newly included participants in the above scholarship program as starting after these participants have obtained the necessary licensure or credentials for VA employment. Prohibits any period of internship, residency, or advanced clinical training as being counted towards the newly-included participant's period of obligated service. Makes applicable to the newly-included occupations in the VA Health Professional Scholarship program the same requirements for the deferral of obligated service as those which apply to occupations specified currently under the program. Authorizes the Administrator to establish a tuition reimbursement program for VA nurses pursuing professional courses leading to a bachelor or an advanced degree in nursing. Authorizes the Administrator to issue regulations implementing such program. Sets forth the eligibility standards that applicants must meet in order to participate in such program. Provides conditions that a participant must meet in order to be entitled to reimbursement (i.e., remain employed with the VA while in the program, successfully completing the courses, and agreeing to the required period of obligated service). Outlines consequences for participants who fail either to complete the courses successfully or to maintain employment with the VA for the required period of obligated service. Empowers the VA to recover any reimbursements paid when the participant breaches the duty to perform the obligated service. Authorizes the Chief Medical Director of the VA to grant waivers of either the VA's right of recovery or the participant's obligation to perform service with the VA when the participant cannot comply due to circumstances beyond the participant's control, or whenever waiver would be in the best interest of the VA. Extends through FY 1992 the program for grants to States for the construction and acquisition of State home facilities for furnishing domiciliary and nursing home care and for the expansion, remodeling, and alteration of State home facilities used for furnishing hospital, domiciliary, and nursing home care. Extends through FY 1991 the date by which the VA must report to the Congress on its evaluation of the respite care program previously authorized under Federal law.</summary>
