  <summary>9/9/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988 - Makes certain findings concerning the use of chemical weapons by Iraq and Iraq's treatment of the Kurdish people. Requires the U.S. Executive Director or representative at all international financial institutions to vote against all loans to Iraq. Prohibits the provision of any assistance, the sale of any kind of military equipment, the provision of any credits, or the provision of any credit guarantees to Iraq. Prohibits the sale or transfer to Iraq of any item subject to export control by any agency of the United States. Prohibits the importation of any oil or petroleum products produced in Iraq. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions if he determines and certifies to the Congress that: (1) Iraq is not committing genocide against the Kurdish population in Iraq; and (2) Iraq is not using chemical weapons banned by the 1925 Geneva Conventions and has provided reliable assurances that it will not use such weapons. Expresses the sense of the Congress: (1) commending the Government of Turkey for its humanitarian decision to host thousands of Kurdish people fleeing extermination in Iraq; and (2) that the United States shall provide assistance to Kurdish refugees in need of medical treatment and other humanitarian aid. Requests the Secretary of State to bring before the United Nations Security Council the matter of Iraq's use of poison gas against its own nationals and to demand that measures be taken against Iraq for its repeated use of chemical weapons.</summary>
