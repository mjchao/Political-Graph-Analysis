National Forest System Public Safety Act of 1988 - Amends the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986 to provide additional law enforcement authority for the Forest Service in dealing with Controlled Substances Act violations by: (1) removing the limitation on the number of Service personnel who may exercise specified law enforcement powers; (2) permitting the exercise of such powers by Service personnel outside of the boundaries of the National Forest System; and (3) authorizing such personnel to conduct investigations of Federal offenses committed within such System in the absence of investigation by any other Federal agency with jurisdiction. Grants the Service authority, with respect to the specified law enforcement powers, to: (1) cooperate with the Attorney General in carrying out the seizure and forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act as such activities relate to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances within the System; and (2) accept law enforcement designation from any other Federal or State agency for the purpose of cooperating, as part of multi-agency task force operations, in the investigation and enforcement of any other Federal or State agency regulations which when violated involve dual jurisdictions. Establishes criminal penalties for: (1) placing injurious devices on or interfering with the administration of Federal lands; and (2) polluting such lands while manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a controlled substance.</summary>
