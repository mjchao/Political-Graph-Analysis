  <summary>10/5/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Temporary Safe Haven Act of 1988 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit alien nationals of certain foreign countries to remain temporarily in the United States for initial periods of between three months and 18 months. Authorizes the Attorney General to so designate a country (or part thereof) only if: (1) there is an ongoing armed conflict which would threaten the safety of returned aliens; (2) a natural disaster has created conditions under which the country cannot handle the return of such aliens, and the country has requested such designation; or (3) extraordinary and temporary conditions exist in the country and the return of such aliens would not be in the national interest of the United States. Requires such designation of a foreign country to be published in the Federal Register in order to become effective. Directs the Attorney General to review the status of a designated country at least annually, and publish in the Federal Register the decision to extend or terminate such status. States that an alien from a designated country shall be eligible for such temporary U.S. residence only if he or she: (1) has been continuously present in the United States since the most recent designation of his or her country's eligibility; and (2) has registered for such benefits. Permits waiver of certain alien excludability provisions for humanitarian or family unity purposes or when otherwise in the public interest. Prohibits such waiver in cases involving certain drug offenses, national security, or Nazi persecutions. Makes an alien ineligible for such benefits if the alien: (1) has been convicted in the United States of a felony or three or more misdemeanors; or (2) has participated in persecution or is a threat to U.S. security. Authorizes registration fees under this Act. States that during such temporary residency an alien: (1) shall not be eligible for public assistance; and (2) shall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law, nor shall such period be considered as physical presence for suspension of deportation purposes. Allows such an alien to: (1) travel abroad temporarily; and (2) work in the United States. States that the statutory procedure established by this Act shall be the Attorney General's exclusive authority to permit specified aliens to remain in the United States temporarily by virtue of their nationality. Directs the Attorney General to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the operation of such temporary residency program. Prohibits judicial review of any determination made by the Attorney General under this Act.</summary>
