  <summary>9/26/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Amends safety equipment requirements to require, subject to exemption by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, that each manned uninspected vessel operating on the high seas or beyond three nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes be equipped with the prescribed number and type of alerting and locating equipment, including emergency position indicating radio beacons. (Current law applies similar requirements only on fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessels.) Increases the civil penalty which may be imposed for violation of this and other statutes and regulations relating to uninspected vessels.</summary>
