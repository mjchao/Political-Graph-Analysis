  <summary>4/8/1987--Introduced.
Permits persons who use an article in the production of a product or who distribute such an article to file with the International Trade Commission a petition requesting the President to issue a proclamation suspending all duties imposed by Federal law on such article. Permits domestic producers of articles for which duties are suspended or of like or directly competitive articles to petition the President to reinstate such duties. Directs the Commission to investigate petitions containing information sufficient to justify an investigation of the suspension or reinstatement of duties. Sets forth determinations to be made through such an investigation, including determinations as to: (1) whether domestic producers of affected articles will be adversely affected by a suspension of duty; and (2) the aggregate amount of Federal revenue derived from duties on such articles. Requires the Commission to: (1) provide any opportunity for any person to submit written and oral statements on the subject of such an investigation; and (2) submit reports on its investigation for publication in the Federal Register, to the petitioner, and to the President within specified time periods. Authorizes the President, within 30 days after the Commission submits a report on suspending duties, to suspend all duties on an article if he determines that; (1) domestic producers would not be adversely affected; (2) the aggregate values of such imports and Federal revenue derived therefrom do not exceed specified amounts; and (3) no foreign country which would benefit from such suspension refuses to provide reciprocal trade concessions. Requires the President, if he does not suspend all duties on an article, to publish a written explanation of that decision. Limits the length of such a suspension of duties to three years. Requires the President, within 30 days after the Commission submits a report on the reinstatement of duties on an article for which duties had been suspended, to either: (1) reinstate them if he determines that a domestic producer is being adversely affected; or (2) publish any negative determination. Makes the President's decisions on reinstating duties final and not subject to review in any court. Directs the United States Trade Representative to initiate negotiations with each foreign country benefiting from each suspension of duties for the purpose of obtaining reciprocal trade concessions from that country. Permits the President to establish schedules for filing petitions and for other actions under this Act.</summary>
