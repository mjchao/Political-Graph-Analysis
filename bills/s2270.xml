Sets forth provisions for within State reservation and allocation. Directs the Governor to reserve 25 percent of the State allotment for specified activities and to allocate the remaining 75 percent to localities with approved applications on a ranking basis. Sets the following limits on apportioning the 25 percent reserved funds: (1) maximum one percent for the State Interagency Advisory Task Force; (2) maximum four percent for administrative costs; (3) minimum five percent for grants to localities in nonmetropolitan areas and to localities to serve migrant and Indian children or, if no such localities apply, for discretionary grants; (4) minimum ten percent for discretionary grants to localities; and (5) minimum five percent for development and implementation of statewide training programs, and technical assistance to localities for training.

Makes any child eligible to participate in programs assisted under this Act: (1) in the school year prior to the school year in which the child would be eligible under State law to enter kindergarten; or (2) at age four, in localities that do not offer kindergarten programs. Permits any State or locality which has served all children of the eligible age group requesting services to use funds to serve children: (1) in the school year two years prior to the school year in which they would be eligible under State law to enter kindergarten; or (2) at age three. Allows States or localities to use funds to expand existing programs serving children aged three through five years, if specified maintenance of effort provisions are met. Sets forth family contribution requirements. Provides services under this Act without charge to eligible children in families with incomes under 115 percent of the poverty line. Requires, for eligible children form families with incomes above 115 percent of the poverty line, payment of fees on a sliding scale up to the full cost of such services. Requires the State, or the locality in a nonparticipating State, to develop such sliding scale on the basis of income level and family size. Prohibits: (1) total fees for all eligible children in a family receiving services under this Act from exceeding ten percent of a family's gross income; and (2) maximum fees per child from exceeding the cost per child of the services provided.
