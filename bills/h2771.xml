  <summary>6/24/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture, through January 1, 1988, from accepting any mortgage loan prepayments on rural rental housing unless: (1) a loan was made or insured at least 20 years prior to the date of prepayment; or (2) in the case of a loan made or insured before December 21, 1979, the Secretary determines that comparable housing is available, or that such prepayment will not result in substantial rent increases to existing tenants.</summary>
