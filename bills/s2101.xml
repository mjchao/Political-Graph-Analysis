  <summary>2/26/1988--Introduced.
Water Resources Development Act of 1988 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out specified public works projects at the following locations: (1) navigation, Lower Ohio River, Locks and Dams 52 and 53, Illinois and Kentucky; (2) flood control, Hazard, Kentucky; (3) navigation, Delaware River, Philadelphia to Wilmington, Pennsylvania and Delaware; and (4) flood control, Truckee Meadows, Nevada. Modifies the project for flood control at Redwood River, Marshall, Minnesota, to authorize the Secretary to construct the project in accordance with a specified memorandum and at increased costs. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to provide for crediting utility relocation costs of harbor construction borne by non-Federal interests to the amount such interests must pay back to the Federal Government over 30 years. Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary to collect recreation user fees at water resources development areas that are used in whole or in part for recreation purposes. Amends the River and Harbor Act of 1970 to authorize the Secretary to continue to deposit dredged materials into a contained spoil disposal facility until the Secretary determines that such facility is no longer needed or that it is completely full. Declares that the authority to construct such new facilities expires on the date of enactment of this Act, except for those projects for which there is an executed agreement. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer funds to another Federal agency or a non-Federal public agency to carry out intensified wildlife management on areas under the jurisdiction of the transferee agency for mitigating fish and wildlife impacts attributable to projects under the Secretary's jurisdiction. Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a demonstration program for a two-year period to provide technical assistance, on a nonexclusive basis, to any U.S. firm which is competing for, or has been awarded, a contract for the planning, design, or construction of a project outside the United States. Requires the firm to: (1) provide funds, in advance, to cover the costs of such assistance; (2) certify that such assistance is not otherwise available; and (3) agree to hold and save the United States free from damages due to the planning, design, construction, operation, or maintenance of the project. Sets forth the authority of the Secretary with respect to an invention made by a Federal employee while providing such assistance. Requires the firm to protect any confidential information which may be provided. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the results of the demonstration program. Authorizes the Secretary to provide services to the non-Federal project sponsor in the design and the construction of upstream and downstream non-Federal extensions to the Federal project for flood control, Brush Creek and Tributaries, Missouri and Kansas, if the non-Federal sponsor provides funds, in advance, to cover all costs of such services. Provides that such extensions shall not be considered a part of the Federal project. Authorizes the construction of a new laboratory for the U.S. Army Engineer Division, Ohio River. Authorizes the Secretary to pay tuition expenses of English-taught primary and secondary education in Puerto Rico for the children of any Federal employee when such expenses are incurred after the date of enactment of this Act and while the employee is temporarily residing and employed in Puerto Rico for the construction of the Portuguese and Bucana Rivers, Puerto Rico, project.</summary>
