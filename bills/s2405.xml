Sets forth provisions for Commission membership, voting, and duties. Directs the Commission to: (1) review and approve applications for assistance for development projects in the region; (2) develop comprehensive and coordinated regional development plans and programs and priorities for their implementation; (3) provide for research and assessments of regional development needs and resources; (4) provide for technical assistance, training programs, and development projects to foster regional (and special need area) productivity and growth; (5) provide for construction of necessary facilities; (6) review, study, and recommend appropriate modifications of public and private development plans for the region; (7) provide assistance for the State development planning process in the region and the coordination of such planning with other Federal and State laws; (8) formulate and recommend appropriate interstate compacts and cooperation; (9) work with State and local agencies in developing appropriate model legislation concerning the region; (10) encourage formation, and help pay administrative expenses, of local development districts; (11) encourage private investment in industrial, commercial, and recreational projects in the region; (12) coordinate development projects in the region; and (13) provide a forum for consideration of regional problems and proposed solutions, establishing and using, as part of such forum, citizens and special advisory councils and public conferences. Authorizes the Commission, in carrying out such duties, to designate areas in the region as being in special need of development assistance, specifying the characteristics of each such area that led to such designation. Limits the amount of the Commission's administrative expense payment to a local development district to 75 percent of the district's administrative expenses for a fiscal year. Limits such payment period to three years in the case of a nonprofit agency or instrumentality of a State which is certified as a local development district, or any local development district succeeding such district. Sets forth provisions for public participation and Commission recordkeeping.

Sets forth annual reporting requirements for each recipient of Federal assistance under this Act and for the Commission. Title II: Development Programs for the Region - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants for planning, constructing, equipping, and operating demonstration health projects approved by the Commission, including projects for hospitals, regional diagnostic and treatment centers, community health centers, and other health facilities, and for provision of services, including nutrition and child care services, not readily available in the region.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts necessary to prepare the plan. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make grants and loans from the United States-Mexico Border Region Housing Fund (established by this Act) to nonprofit organizations, limited dividend and cooperative housing corporations, and public entities for assistance for proposed low- and middle-income housing projects. Permits such grants and loans to be used, with specified exceptions, only for: (1) planning approved housing construction and rehabilitation projects in the region for low- and moderate-income families and individuals; and (2) obtaining federally-insured mortgage financing or other financial assistance for them.

Authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, to provide: (1) technical assistance relating to such projects to nonprofit organizations; and (2) funds to member States to make grants and loans to various entities for such projects. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants for demonstration vocational education projects, approved by the Commission, to construct, equip, and operate new and other school facilities needed to provide vocational education in areas of the region where such facilities are not adequate. Directs the Secretary to make grants to public entities for planning, constructing, equipping, and operating approved demonstration education projects to improve education services and programs in the region.

Authorizes the President to provide funds to the Commission chairperson to assist: (1) persons in the region to supply required matching funds (which will not be considered Federal funds); and (2) Federal officials to make matching share grants under Federal laws for which insufficient funds are available, for projects in the region. Requires States to maintain their current expenditures for the benefit of areas in the region, with specified exceptions. Declares that this Act does not require any State to participate in or carry out any project under this Act without its consent.

Prohibits funds under this Act from being expended to assist any scientific or technological research or development project unless such expenditure is conditioned upon provisions to ensure that all information, copyrights, uses, processes, patents, and other developments resulting from such project will be made freely available to the general public. Directs the Attorney General to enforce such requirement in the appropriate U.S. district court. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations and Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act not otherwise authorized.
