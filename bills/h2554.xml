  <summary>5/28/1987--Introduced.

(Currently such submission must be made 60 days prior to the Secretary's approval and must indicate why any specific recommendation of the Attorney General of any governmental unit was not accepted.) Precludes any leasing program from taking effect unless it is approved by the Congress and enacted into law. Authorizes the Secretary to submit a leasing program for congressional approval at any time.</summary>
