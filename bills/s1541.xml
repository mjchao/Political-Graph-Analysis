  <summary>7/24/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to provide that, for purposes of laws administered by the Veterans Administration providing benefits for qualified veterans, certain specified services performed by seamen in the merchant marine during World War II shall be considered active naval service if the total period of all such service is equal to or exceeds 12 months. Exempts from such 12-month minimum any person who has a permanent disability resulting from personal injury incurred while serving during such period. Directs the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to accept the certification of the Secretary of Transportation or the head of any other department or agency of the Federal Government that a person is qualified to receive such benefits.</summary>
