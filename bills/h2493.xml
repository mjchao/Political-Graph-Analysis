  <summary>5/21/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to increase from eight percent to 15 percent the minimum amount of funds which shall be obligated in any fiscal year for airport noise compatibility programs. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make available ten percent of the funds for a public-use airport to local governmental units and public agencies for noise compatibility program grants if the Secretary finds that such airport is not making reasonable progress towards development and implementation of such a program. Amends the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 to authorize the Secretary to make grants to airport operators and local governmental units to soundproof public buildings used primarily for medical or educational purposes which are adversely affected by airport noise in the noise impact area surrounding the airport.</summary>
