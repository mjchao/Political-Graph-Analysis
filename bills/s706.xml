Bank Holding Company and National Bank Amendment Act of 1987 - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to provide that insurance activity restrictions applicable to bank holding companies shall also apply to any bank or nonbank subsidiary or affiliate thereof. Revises one such restriction to permit bank holding companies to conduct insurance activities in places with populations or 5,000 or less only so long as the principal place of the holding company's bank business is also located in a place with a population of 5,000 or less. Amends the National Bank Act to permit a national bank to conduct insurance activities only so long as such activities are confined to the place in which the bank is located and doing business and the population of such place does not exceed 5,000.</summary>
