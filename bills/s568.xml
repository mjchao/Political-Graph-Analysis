  <summary>2/19/1987--Introduced.
Process Patent Amendments Act of 1987 - Amends the patent laws to make it an infringement of patent to use, sell, or import into the United States without authority a product produced by a process patented in the United States. Requires the infringer to know or be on notice that the product was made by a process patented in the United States before a process patent holder may recover damages. Permits a retailer to continue to sell out an inventory of infringing products subject to specified conditions, including disclosure of the source of supply. Grants the patent holder a reasonable royalty from such sales. Requires a manufacturer to disclose, upon request, the process patents owned or licensed to such manufacturer. Limits such requests to parties engaged in the same business. Conditions the remedy or limitation of remedy upon whether or not a party to an infringement action requested disclosure. Directs the Department of Commerce to report to the Congress annually for five years on the effect such restriction has on the importation of ingredients for U.S. manufacturing.</summary>
