  <summary>3/31/1988--Introduced.
National Biological Diversity Conservation and Environmental Research Act - States that the conservation of biological diversity is a national priority. Requires Federal actions to be consistent with such goal. Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to require that environmental impact statements on proposed Federal actions include any impacts on biological diversity. Directs the President's Council on Environmental Quality to: (1) establish guidelines for consideration of biological diversity in the preparation of environmental impact statements; and (2) identify those biotic communities, species, and populations that appear to be in decline, in imminent danger of loss of viability, or otherwise of special concern. Establishes a National Center for Biological Diversity and Environmental Research (Center) responsible for: (1) coordinating the collection of data pertaining to the national biota and supplementing and disseminating such information; (2) arranging and conducting surveys and supplementary research of the national biota; and (3) enhancing the application of biological data to the conservation of biological diversity. Requires the Center to report annually to the President and the Congress regarding its activities. Establishes an Interagency Working Committee on Biological Diversity responsible for preparing and implementing a coordinated Federal strategy for conservation of biological diversity. Sets forth the required contents of such strategy which must be completed within two years of this Act's enactment. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes each agency represented on the Interagency Committee to provide grants to public agencies, private individuals, and organizations for projects to maintain or restore biological diversity. Requires that such grants be matched on at least an equal basis by the grantee, except when the grantee is a State. Directs each agency, other than the Council on Environmental Quality, represented on the Interagency Committee to: (1) give high priority to research and personnel training directed towards implementation of the Strategy; and (2) assess the adequacy of its environmental research and training programs. Establishes, on a permanent basis, a National Scientific Advisory Committee on Biological Diversity which shall: (1) advise the Interagency Committee in the preparation of the Strategy; (2) assist in the coordination of interaction between the Interagency Committee and the Center; (3) assist in the evaluation of the impacts of proposed Federal activities on biological diversity; (4) review Federal progress toward implementing the Strategy; and (5) serve as a general reference and advisory resource for the Nation in matters relating to conservation of biological diversity. Authorizes appropriations for the activities of the Center and the grant program for FY 1989 through 1991.</summary>
