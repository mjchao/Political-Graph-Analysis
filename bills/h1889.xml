  <summary>4/1/1987--Introduced.
Sets forth guidelines under which the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay the Federal share of project costs incurred by the States for the advance construction of substitute, urban, secondary, bridge, planning, research, and safety construction projects, and for projects on the Federal-aid primary system or the Interstate System. Suspends from January 1, 1987, to September 30, 1990, the prohibition against approval of a State's application for the Federal share of costs for such construction projects if the sum applied for exceeds the authorized and expected apportionment for such State. Directs the State of Virginia and the District of Columbia to restrict the use of the Shirley Highway express lanes to buses, emergency vehicles, and vehicles carrying three or more persons during specified rush hours. Authorizes such jurisdictions to reduce the hours of such restriction. Precludes such jurisdictions from prohibiting the use of such express lanes during hours other than the specified rush hours by a vehicle which is not also prohibited from using the other lanes of the Shirley Highway. Directs the Secretary to withhold a specified percentage of such jurisdictions' fiscal year apportionments for any violations of this Act.</summary>
