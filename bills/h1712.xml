  <summary>3/18/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 to mandate that the Federal Railroad Administration establish demonstration projects to evaluate: (1) whether reflective markers at grade crossings would reduce train accidents; and (2) whether stop or yield signs would reduce such accidents. Directs the Administration to report the results of such projects to certain congressional committees within two years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
