  <summary>5/3/1988--Introduced.
Comdemns the Government of Ethiopia for its use of food as a weapon, its forced resettlement program, and its human rights record. Urges: (1) the Government of Ethiopia to allow the international relief campaign to resume; (2) the Tigrean People's Liberation Front and Eritrean People's Liberation Front to cease attacks upon relief vehicles and relief distribution points; and (3) the President and Secretary of State to press the Ethiopian Government for agricultural reforms, to press for a political settlement to the Ethiopian conflict, and to engage in direct discussion with the Soviet Union to achieve that objective. Urges and authorizes the President to impose such economic sanctions upon Ethiopia as he deems appropriate if Ethiopia engages in specified activities, including forced resettlement and the diversion or denial of international relief. Directs that sanctions imposed include those which substantially affect the major exports of Ethiopia. Authorizes the imposition of sanctions which involve the prohibition or curtailment of exports to Ethiopia under, and subject to the requirements of, provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 relating to national security requirements. Directs the President to report to the Congress every 60 days on whether the Government of Ethiopia engaged in any of the proscribed activities and on any U.S. response to such conduct.</summary>
