  <summary>9/23/1988--House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment.
(House agreed to Senate amendment with an amendment) Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act to authorize funds for grants to States for mining and mineral resources institutes for FY 1990 through FY 1994. Requires such funds to be made available for grants to be matched on a minimum basis of two non-Federal dollars for each Federal dollar. Adds to the list of appropriate institute research subjects the production of fuel and non-fuel mineral resources. Authorizes appropriations for research funds and administrative expenses for FY 1990 through 1994. Increases the composition of the Committee on Mining and Mineral Resources Research by one additional member (from the mining industry). Sets January 15 of each year as the deadline for the Committee's annual plan update to the Congress. Provides that those colleges and universities which, on enactment of this Act, have university-based mining or mineral resources research institute programs which have been found eligible under the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act shall continue to be eligible subject to review at least once during the period authorized by this Act. (Current law continues such eligibility only for those colleges and universities which on August 29, 1984, had such an eligible program.) Requires the results of such review to be submitted by January 15 to certain congressional committees. Directs the Committee on Mining and Mineral Resources Research to submit: (1) a report to certain congressional committees by January 15, 1992, on programs and activities established under the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act of 1984 (including generic mineral technology centers); and (2) a proposal to the Congress by January 15, 1990, to establish a Generic Mineral Technology Center on Strategic and Critical Minerals. Amends the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act to declare that it may be cited as the Mining and Mineral Resources Research Institute Act of 1984.</summary>
