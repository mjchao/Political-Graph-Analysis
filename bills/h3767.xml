Directs the Secretary of Commerce, at the request of the government of a Pacific Island Party, to investigate any alleged infringement of the Treaty involving a U.S. vessel. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, prior to instituting certain proceedings, to notify the Pacific Island Party having jurisdiction and, if that Party objects, prohibits the Secretary from instituting the proceedings.

Requires the total value of any amount collected under the civil or criminal penalties provisions of this title, to the extent required by certain provisions of the Treaty, to be paid by the United States to the Administrator designated by the Pacific Island Parties to act on their behalf. Authorizes the Secretary of State to act for the United States in regard to the Treaty. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992. Title II: Merchant Marine Act, 1920, Amendments - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 to modify the penalty for transportation of merchandise between points in the United States in other than domestically built or rebuilt and documented vessels to impose a penalty, in the case of transportation of valueless material, in the amount of the value of the transportation provided. Applies such provision to the transportation of valueless material from a point in the United States to another point on the high seas within the Exclusive Economic zone (EEZ). Declares that the transportation of any platform jacket in or on a launch barge shall not be deemed transportation which is subject to this provision if the barge meets certain requirements. Amends Federal law to make applicable to the towing of a vessel transporting valueless material from a point in the United States to another point on the high seas within the EEZ current provisions prohibiting the towing of vessels by vessels not owned by a citizen of the United States and documented under provisions of Federal law. Permits a documented vessel to transport municipal sewerage sludge to a deepwater disposal site designated under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, provided such vessel, as of enactment of this Act, is under construction or contract for use by a municipality for the transportation of sewerage sludge. Declares that, for purposes of a provision of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 regarding forbidden practices in coastwise service, a vessel documented under U.S. laws and under contract with a municipality for the transportation of sewerage as of enactment of this Act is not a vessel engaged in domestic intercoastal or coastwise services. Provides that such vessels are bound by a provision prohibiting the diversion of any money, property, or other thing of value, used in foreign-trade operations, for which a subsidy is paid by the United States, into any coastwise or intercoastal operations. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a coastwise certificate of documentation, endorsed to restrict use of the vessel to transportation of valueless material, to a vessel which meets certain requirements.
