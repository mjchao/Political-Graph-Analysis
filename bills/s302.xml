  <summary>1/12/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an import fee on: (1) the first sale within the United States of any crude oil or any refined petroleum product imported into the United States; and (2) the use within the United States of any crude oil or any refined petroleum product imported into the United States if no such tax has been imposed prior to such use. Exempts from such tax crude oil or refined petroleum products purchased for export. Specifies that such fee shall be imposed only at a time when the average international price of crude oil for any four-week period is less than $18 per barrel. Sets the rate of such tax as the difference between $18 per barrel and the average international price of crude oil for the preceding four-week period.</summary>
