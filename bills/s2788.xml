  <summary>9/14/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, with respect to the standards applicable for cleanup of hazardous waste at steel and aluminum manufacturing facilities, to require that groundwater correction measure standards be met at the facility's property boundary (rather than at the boundary of each individual solid waste management unit). Requires groundwater monitoring at facility boundaries and other locations. Requires the establishment by facility owners or operators of a fund to provide financial owners or operators of a fund to provide financial responsibility for monitoring and corrective measures for 30 years following cessation of operations.</summary>
