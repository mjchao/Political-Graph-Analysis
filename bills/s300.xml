  <summary>1/12/1987--Introduced.
New Clean Air Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to limit after 1990 the number of hours a fossil-fuel-burning electric generating facility which is a major stationary source of sulfur dioxide emissions may operate according to its emissions rate. Requires such major sources to attain by 1995 the best degree of emission reduction technically available. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to publish demonstrated levels of emission reduction and to promulgate emission standards for oil shale production and processing facilities, synthetic fuels production facilities, and other categories of major energy-production sources. Requires the use of systems for gasoline vapor recovery of hydrocarbon emissions from fueling of motor vehicles in every air quality region which fails to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by 1988. Increases the length of time control systems on cars must last. Requires vehicles after model year 1988 to be equipped with onboard hydrocarbon control technology. Sets standards for emissions of hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates from light-duty vehicles and engines for implementation in model years 1992, 1990, and 1991, respectively. Sets emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines for model years after 1990. Sets emission standards for light-duty trucks and engines for model years 1990 and after. Prohibits the sale of diesel fuel with a sulfur content above a certain level determined by the Administrator. Provides for the assessment of daily civil penalties for violations of the fuel and fuel additive regulatory requirements. Requires State vehicle inspection programs to require emissions testing or direct inspection of components of vehicle emissions control systems. Directs the Administrator to implement a monitoring system for assessing the effects of acid deposition by July 1, 1988. Makes it a violation of the Clean Air Act if a State's air pollutant emissions contribute to the violation of another State's water quality standard under the Clean Water Act. Amends the Clean Water Act to state that such emissions endanger health or welfare abroad if they contribute to the violation of such country's water quality standards. Directs the President to negotiate with Canada and Mexico by 1988 to cooperate in reducing air pollution. Directs the President to negotiate treaties or other international agreements to apply uniform standards of performance for the control of air pollutant emissions. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress by 1989 on a system of tariffs on emissions sufficient to encourage reductions.</summary>
