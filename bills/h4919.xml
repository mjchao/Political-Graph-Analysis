  <summary>10/4/1988--House disagreed to Senate amendment.
(House disagreed to Senate amendment under suspension of the rules, roll call #404 (412-5)) Approves, notwithstanding any provision of the Magnuson Fishery and Conservation and Management Act, the governing international fishery agreement (GIFA) entered into between the United States and the Soviet Union, as contained in the presidential message to the Congress on June 22, 1988. Authorizes appropriations for the development of a Marine Biomedical Institute for Advanced Studies, to be located at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Amends the Great Lakes Shoreline Mapping Act of 1987 to authorize appropriations for FY 1989 for preparation of a Great Lakes shoreline mapping plan. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to make it illegal for any fishing vessel other than a vessel of the United States to operate in the Exclusive Economic Zone if all fishing gear is not stored (or secured and covered) so as to make it unavailable or unusable for fishing, unless the vessel is authorized to engage in fishing in the area in which it is operating. Directs the Secretary of State to establish an advisory body on the fisheries of the North Pacific and the Bering Sea to advise the U.S. representative to the International Consultative Committee created under the GIFA. Exempts the body from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Directs the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, as appropriate, to exercise their authority under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require the use of position-fixing and identification equipment on any vessel other than a vessel of the United States engaged in fishing in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Directs those Secretaries to report to specified committees of the Congress regarding their compliance. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer the decommissioned Coast Guard cutter "Glacier" to the State of Oregon for use as a maritime museum and display.</summary>
