  <summary>6/26/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal law regarding stock-raising homesteads to prohibit any person from entering lands for purposes of prospecting for hardrock minerals unless written notice has been provided to the surface owner. (Under current law, private ranchers own the surface of lands whose subsurface mineral rights are owned by the United States.) Sets forth conditions under which a person may mine or remove hardrock mineral deposits, including the posting of bond to cover land reclamation expenses. Requires compensation payments to the surface owner for damages to crops or loss of income. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to suspend or revoke the approval of a mining or prospecting plan of operations if the mine operator fails to remedy any plan violations. Sets forth conditions under which treble damages may be awarded to an aggrieved surface owner.</summary>
