  <summary>5/11/1987--Introduced.
Repeals specified provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that place limitations on: (1) individual retirement account (IRA) deductions for active participants in certain pension plans; and (2) nondeductible contributions to individual retirement plans. States that the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) shall be applied and administered as if such provisions had not been enacted. Amends the IRC to permit an individual filing a joint income tax return to include a spouse's compensation in calculations to determine the maximum amount permitted as a deduction for qualified retirement contributions (thus permitting a nonworking or the lesser-earning spouse a deduction of up to $2,000 for IRA contributions).</summary>
