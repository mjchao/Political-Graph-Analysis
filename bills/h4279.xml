  <summary>3/29/1988--Introduced.
Sets standards to assure the safe transportation of school children to, from, or on military installations owned or controlled by the United States and located outside the United States. Directs the Secretary of each military department to provide that the commanding officer of each U.S. military installation which has personnel with school children contract or otherwise provide for the use of motor vehicles as school buses to transport children to and from a Department of Defense Office of Dependent Schools (DODDS) institution. Sets minimum precautions to be taken by DODDS and each military department to protect school children from injury while being transported to and from DODDS institutions. Directs DODDS to develop a training program for all persons who operate school buses and makes successful completion of such program a prerequisite to operating a school bus. Specifies that such program shall include training in areas such as safe boarding and discharging of school children, safe driving techniques, and first-aid. Directs the appropriate Secretary to require each DODDS school to hold drills in leaving school buses under emergency conditions. Sets requirements for school bus equipment, including warning devices, warning signs, and safety belts. Directs that school buses be maintained as required by local law. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to issue and enforce other lawful maintenance regulations which are reasonably likely to make the transportation of school children safer. Sets forth mandatory qualifications for school bus operators, including English language ability and passage of a special examination on the safe operation of a school bus. Prohibits any military department from hiring any person to operate a school bus transporting pupils unless such person meets specified requirements, including passing a physical examination, providing a copy of department of motor vehicle (DMV) records showing that the person had not been convicted of certain driving or criminal offenses, is between the ages of 18 and 70, and successfully completed a first-aid course. Requires that results of the physical examination and DMV records be furnished annually. Prohibits any operator from performing services in excess of eight hours in any 24-hour period or from operating a school bus without wearing a safety lap belt. Sets forth procedures for establishing bus routes, loading and unloading of passengers, seating of passengers, and railroad crossings to maximize safety. Makes a person guilty of reckless driving if he or she fails to stop when approaching from any direction a clearly marked school bus which is taking on or discharging school children on Federal property, unless the bus is stopped on the other side of a divided roadway or on a driveway which is separated by a physical barrier or unpaved area from the roadway on which he is driving. Sets a maximum speed limit of 25 miles per hour on U.S.-owned or controlled property, between "school" or "school crossing" signs. Establishes additional requirements related to signs.</summary>
