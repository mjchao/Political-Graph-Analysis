  <summary>8/7/1987--Introduced.
Individual Education Savings Account Act of 1987 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an individual taxpayer an income tax deduction for cash contributions to a savings account established to pay the tuition and lodging expenses, as certified by the relevant educational institution, of the taxpayer's child (or descendant of such child) at an institution of higher education or a vocational school. Limits the amount of the deduction to $2,000 per year and a $48,000 total. Provides that: (1) an account may have only one beneficiary; and (2) only one taxpayer may contribute to such an account. Lists requirements applicable to an educational savings account trust. Permits the exclusion from gross income of payments and distributions from an education savings account as long as such amounts are used for the qualified educational expenses of the eligible beneficiary or are distributions of excess contributions before the due date of the tax return. Exempts the accounts themselves from taxation (except for the tax on unrelated business income of a charitable organization) unless they cease to be proper education savings accounts because: (1) the beneficiary no longer meets age or school enrollment requirements; or (2) the contributor-taxpayer transfers an ownership interest in the account, engages in prohibited transactions, or pledges the account as security. Imposes penalties in the form of additional tax when account funds or distributions are used for other than educational purposes. Permits a tax exclusion for qualified rollover contributions with respect to an educational savings account. Requires that the trustee of the account report to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the account's owner on the maintenance of the account. Extends the deduction for contributions to the account to taxpayers who do not otherwise itemize deductions. Establishes: (1) a six percent excise tax on excess contributions to an education savings account; (2) a five percent excise tax on amounts connected with any prohibited transaction; and (3) a penalty for failure to file reports required concerning the account. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 with respect to the treatment of education savings accounts under Federal student financial aid programs. Identifies the role of account funds and distributions for purposes of Pell grant eligibility determinations and the needs analysis applicable to student financial aid generally. Provides that contributions from such funds by persons with income of less than $35,000 will be indexed according to a special specified formula when calculating eligibility for student aid.</summary>
