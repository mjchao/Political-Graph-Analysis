Occupational Disease Prevention Act of 1987 - Title I: Hazard Communication Standard Amendment - Directs the Secretary of Labor within one year after this Act's enactment to amend the hazard communication standard contained in specified Federal regulations to: (1) require employers to notify current employees of their right to obtain information from their previous employers and current employers; and (2) require employers to transmit health hazard notices to former employees. Directs the Secretary to: (1) consider specified factors in the process of the rulemaking proceedings related to the promulgation of the hazard communication standard amendment; and (2) prescribe methods and procedures for the enforcement of recordkeeping requirements relating to employee exposure to certain potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents. Requires all Federal agencies with the responsibility for establishing health and safety standards for workers not covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to promulgate a hazard communication standard consistent with that promulgated by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to prepare and distribute public service announcements informing current and former employees concerning: (1) their rights to information and training, including rights of access to employee exposure and medical records; and (2) the availability of material safety data sheets for hazardous chemicals. Establishes within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration an Office of Hazards Communication to be responsible, among other things, for implementing the hazard communication standard and providing information to employers and to the public with respect to occupational hazards. Directs the Secretary, within one year of this Act's enactment, to promulgate revisions of standards (popularly known as Z-tables) related to employee exposure to various air contaminants and to develop means to ensure necessary updates to adjust permissible exposure limits. Describes the regulatory framework applicable to the administration and enforcement of the hazard communication standard and to its violations. Establishes criminal penalties for willful violations of the standard when there is a substantial probability that death or serious harm could result. Declares that information provided to an employee under the standard shall not commence the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to any legal claim, except as specifically provided by State law. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) evaluate the standard's effectiveness in accordance with guidelines detailed in this Act; and (2) report the results to the Congress within 30 months after this Act's enactment. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Interim NIOSH Notification Program - Directs the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to establish and implement an individual worker notification program for workers at high risk of disease due to occupational exposures who were or are involved in any retrospective cohort mortality study conducted by the Institute before or after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for such program. Title III: Risk Notification Commission - Establishes the Risk Notification Study Commission to study and to report to the Congress concerning specified topics with respect to high risk notification programs. Terminates the Commission 30 days following the submission of its required report. Authorizes appropriations for the Commission.</summary>
