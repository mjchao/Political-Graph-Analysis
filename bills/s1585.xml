  <summary>8/3/1987--Introduced.
Even Start Act - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to add a new Chapter 3: Even Start Programs. Provides for grants to integrate early childhood education and adult education for parents into a unified program. Allocates program grants to States in the same proportion as under the allocation of ECIA chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet the Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) funds. Sets a maximum and minimum for such State allotments. Requires that funds made available to local educational agencies (LEAs) under this Act be used to pay the Federal share of the cost of providing family-centered education programs to help parents to become full partners in the education of their children and assist children to reach their full potential as learners. Sets forth program elements. Limits the Federal share to 80 percent of program costs in the first year, 60 percent in the second, 40 percent in the third, and 20 percent in the fourth and any subsequent year. Allows the non-Federal share to be obtained from any available source, including Federal, State, and local programs. Makes eligible for participation in this program families that include: (1) a parent who is eligible for participation in an adult basic education program under the Adult Education Act; and (2) a child aged one to seven, inclusive, who resides in a school attendance area designated for participation in chapter 1 programs. Set forth LEA application requirements. Requires each State educational agency to award grants on the basis of proposals which meet specified criteria. Provides that grants may be awarded for up to four years. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide for the annual independent evaluation of programs under this part; and (2) submit to the Congress an annual review and summary of the results of such evaluations. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993 to carry out this Act.</summary>
