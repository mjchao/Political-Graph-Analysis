  <summary>7/20/1987--Introduced.
Title I: Medicare Catastrophic Illness Coverage Act - Medicare Catastrophic Illness Coverage Act - Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove durational limitations on the coverage of inpatient hospital services. Provides coverage of post-hospital extended care services for up to 100 days each year. (Currently such services are provided for up to 100 days during a "spell of illness".) Requires a beneficiary to pay a deductible for each of the first two inpatient hospital admissions in a year. (Currently an inpatient hospital deductible is required for each "spell of illness.") Eliminates the coinsurance requirement for inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital extended care services. Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program to cover the amount by which a part B enrollee's out-of-pocket expenses exceed $2,000 in 1988, adjusting such ceiling thereafter to reflect changes in total Medicare per capita expenses. Excludes from the computation of a beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses amounts above the full part B payment to physicians and others who do not accept assignment. Extends, until 1991, the limitation of the part B basic premium to 25 percent of part B costs (excluding costs resulting from this Act's catastrophic coverage). Imposes an additional premium on part B enrollees which represents an amount equal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services' estimate of a part B enrollee's share of the benefits and administrative costs which result from this Act's catastrophic care coverage and beneficiary expense ceiling. Provides for the transfer to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund of part B premium revenues which are attributable to the catastrophic care coverage this Act establishes under part A of the Medicare program. Covers nursing care and home health aide services as home health services if such services are needed less than seven days each week or are needed for an initial period of up to 35 consecutive days and for a subsequent period on a physician's certification that exceptional circumstances warrant continued home health services. Imposes an additional premium on part B enrollees to cover the costs of supplemental daily home health services. Provides for the transfer of premium revenues to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Act to provide Medicaid coverage of prescription drugs for individuals age 65 or older whose income does not exceed 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. Subjects beneficiaries to an annual $50 deductible for such coverage. Provides that for the initial determination of an institutionalized spouse's Medicaid eligibility the institutionalized spouse may transfer his or her resources to the community spouse to the extent the spousal share (computed by dividing the sum of the spouse's resources in half) is less than $12,000 (adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost-of-living), but attributes any resources not solely in the ownership of the community spouse to the institutionalized spouse if such transfer is not made. Considers resources held in the name of the community spouse to be available to the institutionalized spouse to the extent their value exceeds $48,000 (adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost-of-living), or, if greater, the amount a court has ordered to be retained by the community spouse for support. Provides that after the initial eligibility determination: (1) no resources of the community spouse will be considered available to the institutionalized spouse; and (2) the income of the institutionalized spouse will not be considered to include a specified personal needs allowance, community spouse monthly income allowance, family allowance, and incurred expenses for medical or remedial care for the institutionalized spouse that are not covered by a legally liable third party. Sets forth the formulas for determining such allowances. Gives the institutionalized spouse the right to a hearing to establish that the community spouse monthly income allowance is not adequate to support the community spouse without financial duress so that an adequate amount of support will be substituted for the allowance. Prohibits such allowance from being less than court-ordered support payments. Delays the Medicaid eligibility of institutionalized individuals who disposed of their resources at less than fair market value within two-years prior to applying for Medicaid benefits. Sets forth situations in which a delay shall not be applied. Allows the institutionalized spouse to elect to be governed by State rules in effect as of March 1, 1987, regarding treatment of income and transfers of resources for Medicaid eligibility purposes, but permits neither spouse to opt out of this Act's rules regarding the treatment of resources at the initial eligibility determination. Directs the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to include in their reports to the Congress in April 1988 an analysis, performed by the Secretary of Treasury, of options to strengthen the long-term solvency of such Trust Funds. Title II: Tax Provisions Related to Long-Term Care Insurance - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat certain long-term care insurance which the Secretary certifies is providing coverage to each covered person who is age 50 or older for at least one year for diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitation, maintenance, or personal care services provided in a setting other than the acute care unit of a hospital as accident or health insurance when taxing issuers of such insurance (hereafter referred to as qualified long-term care insurance). Requires such issuers to be reinsured by the Federal National Long-term Care Reinsurance Corporation if such Corporation is incorporated as of January 1, 1990. Provides that for the purpose of determining whether a tax exclusion applies to employer contributions to, or an employee's receipt of benefits from, qualified long-term care insurance such contributions and benefits shall be considered to be for personal injury or sickness, and medical care. Excludes from taxation: (1) the portion of distributions from individual retirement plans which is used during the year to pay the premiums for qualified long-term care coverage of individuals who are age 59 1/2 or older on the date of distribution; and (2) amounts received, when an individual who has attained age 65 surrenders, cancels, or exchanges a life insurance contract, and used during such year to pay the premiums for qualified long-term care insurance. Title III: Federal National Long-Term Care Reinsurance Corporation - Federal National Long-Term Care Reinsurance Corporation Act - Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the incorporation of the Federal National Long-Term Care Reinsurance Corporation (Corporation), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the U.S. Government. Requires the Corporation to confine its activities to reinsuring insurance companies for extraordinary loss in the issuance or payment of qualified long-term care insurance benefits. Sets forth organizing and administrative provisions with respect to the Corporation. Exempts the Corporation from State regulation and taxation. Directs the Corporation to report annually to the President and the Congress regarding its activities.</summary>
