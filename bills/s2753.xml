  <summary>8/25/1988--Introduced.
Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to require all agencies of the Federal Government to include a detailed environmental impact assessment with every recommendation for a U.S. vote on a proposed action by an international financial institution significantly affecting the quality of the environment. Provides that the assessment required should be obtained from the institution proposing the action. Requires all agencies to: (1) inform the management of the institutions of the information expected to be obtained; and (2) begin negotiations with institution management to facilitate the requirements of this Act within the framework of international agreements and without weakening the position of the United States within the institution.</summary>
