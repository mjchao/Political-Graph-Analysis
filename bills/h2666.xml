  <summary>6/11/1987--Introduced.
Acid Deposition Control Act of 1987 - Title I: Stationary Sources - Amends the Clean Air Act to require each Governor to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for approval a two-phased plan establishing emission limitations and compliance schedules for sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions from fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units in the State. Requires reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions by 1993 and reductions in oxides of nitrogen and further reductions in sulfur dioxide by 1997. Directs each Governor to submit to the Administrator for approval an emissions limitations plan for such units, other than electric utilities' units, requiring both sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions reductions by 1997. Requires the Administrator to conduct and update an inventory of such emissions from stationary sources, identifying the total statewide potential reductions in such emissions and transmitting such information to the State by the close of 1990. Requires each Governor to submit to the Administrator by June 1, 1994, a plan for establishing emission limitations from stationary sources of industrial process emissions to achieve such State's potential reductions by 1997. Directs the Administrator to promulgate guidelines for State plans which shall ensure that emissions reductions do not have an unnecessarily disproportionate effect on electric utility ratepayers. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress by June 30, 1993, on the reductions achieved during phase I, granting the Congress an opportunity to legislate by the start of 1994 against the implementation of phase II. Grants States an opportunity to modify disapproved plans. Establishes emissions standards and Administrator-promulgated plans for States without an approved plan. Directs the Administrator to impose a fee on the generation and importation of electric energy if any electric utility is eligible for a sulfur dioxide emissions reduction subsidy. Sets fees in such a way as to raise sufficient subsidy revenue and protect low income residential electric consumers. Establishes civil penalties for violations of fee-related requirements. Establishes in the Treasury the Acid Deposition Control Fund to make subsidy payments to electric utilities to cover a portion of rate increases attributable to emission reduction compliance. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on such Fund. Requires a State to assure that rate increases so attributable are substantially equivalent for ratepayers throughout the State and substantially levelized over the period of their application in order to be eligible for the subsidy. Requires the Administrator to determine subsidy eligibility, based in part on the reasonableness of a utility's compliance costs. Authorizes the Administrator to provide financial assistance to owners and operators of stationary sources to promote innovative emissions technologies which are cost-effective. Requires State plans which include the use of such technologies to meet its emission limitation reductions to include contingent limitations and compliance schedules for stationary sources. Requires such contingent limitations to be at least equivalent to the reductions the innovative technology failed to achieve. Permits States to later modify their plans to include innovative technology. Authorizes the Administrator to impose fees on the generation of electricity in a State at its request to promote the use of innovative technologies. Requires the Administrator to report on the status of such technologies before 1994. Directs the Administrator to revise performance standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides from electric utility steam generating units which burn bituminous or subbituminous coal. Requires the Administrator to promulgate performance standards for oxides of nitrogen emissions from certain fossil-fuel-fired steam generating units. Requires all primary nonferrous smelters to be in compliance with the applicable emission limitation or standard for sulfur oxides by January 2, 1988. Title II: Control of Emissions From Mobile Sources - Amends the Clean Air Act to establish emissions standards for oxides of nitrogen for motor vehicles during and after model year 1989. Establishes hydrocarbon standards for trucks during and after model year 1990. Limits the sulfur content of motor vehicle diesel fuel after January 1, 1989. Requires the Administrator to require either onboard hydrocarbon control technology or the use of gasoline vapor recovery of hydrocarbon emissions emanating from the fueling of motor vehicles.</summary>
