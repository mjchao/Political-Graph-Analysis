  <summary>3/30/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Reclamation Project Authorization Act of 1972 to increase the acreage to be irrigated by the O'Neill Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, Nebraska. Includes as a purpose of such project the provision of data as a demonstration of conventional and advanced artificial groundwater recharge technology. Provides that all costs related to the collection, analysis, and dissemination of such data shall be nonreimbursable. Describes the principal features of the unit. Declares that any irrigation costs chargeable for the unit that are beyond the ability of water users to repay may be repaid from power revenues. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, prior to expending or obligating funds for such unit, to enter into contracts with duly constituted entities for the appropriate payment of costs allocated to irrigation. Directs the Secretary, until the unit construction costs are repaid, to charge a surplus crop production charge under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into an interagency agreement to provide for a cooperative evaluation of the impacts to surface water and groundwater quality that may result from the project. Authorizes appropriations as necessary, but not to exceed the amount specified in the comprehensive feasibility study by the Secretary of the O'Neill Unit as modified by this Act. Prohibits the expenditure of construction funds until the Congress has had 90 days to review the feasibility study.</summary>
