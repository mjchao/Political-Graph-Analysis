  <summary>10/12/1988--House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment.
(House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment) Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 - Title I: Natural Gas Pipelines Safety - Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to certify and require testing of individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards, within one year after enactment of this Act, requiring pipeline facility operators to provide certain information to the Secretary or appropriate requesting State official, including: (1) the operator's business name, address, and telephone numbers; (2) accurate maps showing the location of major pipeline facilities, including transmission and major distribution lines; (3) a description of the characteristics of the operator's pipelines within the State; (4) a description of all products transported through such pipelines in the State; (5) an operations and maintenance manual; (6) an emergency response plan; and (7) any other information the Secretary considers useful and necessary to inform the States of pipeline facilities and operations within their boundaries. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards to require, within one year after enactment of this Act, pipeline facility operators to complete and maintain an inventory of all types of pipe used to transmit gas in the operator's system, together with other specified information. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish qualifications for States to meet for the pipeline safety grant program, including qualifications for State employees who perform inspections pursuant to either an annual certification by a State agency or an agreement relating to inspection between the State agency and the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to promote more effective coordination between Federal and State pipeline regulatory agencies regarding pipeline accident responses. Increases the daily and maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety violations from $1,000 to $10,000, and $200,000 to $500,000, respectively. Establishes criminal penalties (fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both) for the willful and knowing defacement, damage, removal, or destruction of any pipeline sign or right-of-way marker required by Federal law or regulation. Directs the Secretary to biennially inspect and require the testing of pipeline facilities to ensure their safety. Provides that the frequency of such inspections may be reduced with respect to master meter systems. Outlines the testing and inspection criteria for such inspections. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards requiring that the design, construction, or replacement of transmission facilities or equipment accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices ("smart pigs"). Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the findings and recommendations resulting from a needs assessment study regarding an improved master meter inspection program. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate State officials prior to conducting pipeline facilities testing in their jurisdictions. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to expend specified funds to establish a training program for the installation, operation, and maintenance of a natural gas system using a master metering system in lieu of separate meters. Title II: Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety - Amends the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to certify and require testing of individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish, within one year after enactment of this Act, minimum Federal standards requiring pipeline facility operators to provide certain information to the Secretary or appropriate requesting State official, including: (1) the operator's business name, address, and telephone numbers; (2) accurate maps showing the location of major pipeline facilities; (3) a description of the characteristics of the operator's pipelines within the State; (4) a description of all products transported through such pipelines in the State; (5) an operations and maintenance manual; (6) an emergency response plan; and (7) any other information the Secretary considers useful and necessary to inform the States of pipeline facilities and operations within their boundaries. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards, within one year after enactment of this Act, to require pipeline facility operators to complete and maintain an inventory of all types of pipe used to transmit hazardous liquids in the operator's system, together with other specified information. Authorizes the Secretary by regulation to establish qualifications for States to meet for the pipeline safety grant program, including qualifications for State employees who perform inspections pursuant to either an annual certification by a State agency or an agreement relating to inspection between the State agency and the Secretary. Increases the daily and maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety violations from $1,000 to $10,000, and from $200,000 to $500,000, respectively. Establishes criminal penalties (fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both) for the willful and knowing defacement, damage, removal, or destruction of any pipeline sign or right-of-way marker required by Federal law or regulation. Directs the Secretary to inspect biennially and to require the testing of pipeline facilities to ensure their safety. Outlines the testing and inspection criteria for such inspections. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards requiring that the design, construction, or replacement of transmission facilities or equipment accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices ("smart pigs"). Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate State officials prior to conducting pipeline facilities testing in their jurisdictions. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to promote more effective coordination between Federal and State pipeline regulatory agencies regarding pipeline accident responses. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991. Grants the Secretary regulatory authority over carbon dioxide pipeline transportation. Title III: Generally Applicable Pipeline Safety Provisions - Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 to authorize appropriations for Federal grants-in-aid for FY 1988 through 1991. Sets a maximum allocation of 20 percent for pipeline safety indirect expenses. Makes unexpended FY 1986 and 1987 funds available for additional grants to States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991 for additional safety inspection personnel. Directs the Secretary, in making grant-in-aid allocations, to consider whether a State has adopted or is seeking adoption of a one-call notification program. Permits the Secretary to deny the full reimbursement under the program if the State has not adopted nor is seeking adoption of such a program. Sets forth the requirements of such a program, including a one-call system for all areas of the State containing underground pipelines or underground electric transmission or distribution lines posing a safety threat. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to establish minimum Federal requirements for such system. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1991 for such one-call notification systems grants to the States. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of requiring the inspection of transmission facilities with instrumented internal inspection devices after considering specified factors. Requires a report of such study to the Congress within 18 months after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility, safety, cost, and effectiveness of requiring pipeline facility operators to install emergency flow restricting devices in existing and future pipeline systems. Requires a report to the Congress on such study within one year after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to assess the feasibility of regulating persons whose excavation activities may result in pipeline damage and to report the results of such assessment to the Congress. Directs the Secretary to add at least two more pipeline safety instructors at the Transportation Safety Institute. Declares that certain recodification of Federal transportation law does not substantively affect existing Federal jurisdiction or legislation regarding oil pipelines.
