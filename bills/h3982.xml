Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to the coordination and effectiveness of Federal and State regulation of real estate appraisal practices. Declares that: (1) each State should respond to abuses occurring in the real estate appraisal profession by providing reasonable and fair regulation of appraisers; (2) each State should enact legislation establishing real estate appraiser boards to carry out voluntary appraiser certification; (3) each Federal agency should require State certified appraisals where determined appropriate; (4) the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council should monitor Federal agencies in making such determinations; and (5) the Council should periodically report to specified congressional committees on the effectiveness of Federal and State actions taken pursuant to this resolution.</summary>
