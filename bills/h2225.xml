  <summary>4/29/1987--Introduced.
Universal National Service Act of 1987 - States that it is the obligation of each citizen of the United States between the ages of 18 and 25 to serve for one year with the United States, in accordance with this Act. Establishes in the executive branch the Agency for National Service (the Agency) to administer the national service program established by this Act, hear appeals of hardship deferment decisions, and prescribe necessary regulations to carry out this Act. Outlines administrative provisions concerning the composition, headquarters, and local placement centers of such Agency. Requires each citizen of the United States , within ten days after attaining age 18, to register with the Agency. Provides also for the registration of citizens currently over the age of 18 and under the age of 25. Requires each local placement center for the Agency to: (1) provide all such individuals with any necessary information concerning such required service; (2) provide counselors to assist such registrants; and (3) provide for the completion by such registrants of all forms necessary under this Act. Allows registrants to choose their form of service from the following options: (1) the armed forces; (2) the Peace Corps; or (3) the Community Service Program. Provides that any registrant who fails to make such an election shall be deemed to have chosen the armed forces for his or her form of service. Provides for the discharge of such service obligation if the registrant has exhausted all service options due to a refusal by any agency or program to accept such registrant. Directs the Agency to establish and administer a community service program for persons to fulfill their civilian service requirement, providing for education, recreation, and rehabilitation projects to be accomplished under such program. Exempts the following from any obligation to serve or to register under this Act: (1) cadets and midshipmen of the service academies; (2) all persons serving in the armed forces prior to December 31, 1988; and (3) all persons determined to be physically, mentally, or otherwise unfit for service under this Act. Provides temporary deferments from any obligations to serve or register under this Act for the following persons: (1) those found to be physically, mentally, or otherwise unfit for service under this Act on a temporary basis, the deferment lasting as long as such condition continues; (2) persons accepted into or attending graduate school; (3) persons accepted into or attending medical, dental, or law school (with certain alternate obligations required from such persons upon graduation from such schools); and (4) those granted a hardship deferment from a local placement center in accordance with this Act. Provides that the provisions of the Military Selective Service Act, as such Act applies to the Selective Service System, shall apply to those persons who fail to register and serve as required under this Act.</summary>
