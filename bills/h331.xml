  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to authorize the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to request a head of a Federal agency, department, or unit to appear before the Commission and explain the reason for failing to submit an equal employment opportunity plan. Directs the Commission, after an opportunity for a hearing, to order such agency, department, or unit to submit a plan. Requires the Commission to enforce compliance with such order. Authorizes the Commission to initiate, through the appropriate agency head, disciplinary action, including the withholding of pay, against any officer or employee responsible for failure to comply with an order. States that the equal employment opportunity plans shall include the numerical employment goals established by such agency, department, or unit in its minority recruitment program and that each agency should establish numerical employment goals for the purpose of complying with affirmative action plans.</summary>
