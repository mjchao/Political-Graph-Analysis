  <summary>9/15/1988--Introduced.
Stillwater Wildlife Management Area Restoration and Enhancement Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Interior (the Secretary), within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to initiate consultation with the Nevada Department of Wildlife in order to prepare a Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act report on the impact of the permanent operating criteria and procedures for the Newlands Reclamation project, Nevada, on the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area and other wetlands in the Lahontan Valley, Nevada. Requires a copy of the completed report to be submitted to specified congressional committees within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to initiate a dialogue with the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Indian Tribe, the State of Nevada, interested local governments within the Carson and Truckee River basins, and the Lahontan Valley Wetlands Coalition to: (1) develop a draft long term plan to maintain a specified average acreage of high quality wetland habitat in the Lahontan Valley; and (2) enhance wildlife habitat comprising the Stillwater component of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network. Directs the Secretary: (1) within one year after enactment of this Act, to conduct public meetings in Reno, Fallon, and Carson City, Nevada, to seek comment on such draft plan; and (2) within 90 days after the last of such meetings, publish a final plan, and make recommendations to the Congress on any new authority or appropriations that may be necessary to fully implement the plan. Directs the Secretary to consider possible cost-sharing arrangements involving a mix of Federal, State, and private funds, in identifying funding mechanisms to implement the plan. Prohibits expenditure of any Federal fund by any party to prevent or impede: (1) the orderly transfer of water rights from willing sellers, under Nevada law, to the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area, or the Nevada Department of Wildlife or the Lahontan Valley Wetlands Coalition for the benefit of Stillwater Wildlife Management Area; or (2) the orderly implementation of the plan, once it is submitted to the Congress.</summary>
