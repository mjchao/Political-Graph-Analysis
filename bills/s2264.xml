  <summary>10/11/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to exchange certain lands in New Mexico for: (1) certain mining interests in land withdrawn for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and New Mexico State University; and (2) specified lands owned by the University, regardless of a provision for reversion of title to the University. Prohibits the University from selling lands transferred to it under this Act. Requires the University to use such lands for educational, scientific, and research activities and for promoting the use of natural geothermal resources located therein. Provides that if the University violates the conditions, title to such lands will revert to the United States.</summary>
