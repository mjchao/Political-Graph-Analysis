  <summary>3/31/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal law regarding vehicle weight limitations on the Interstate System to prohibit the apportionment of Federal funds to any State which prohibits vehicles with certain triaxle (tridem) weights from using the national Interstate System within its boundaries. Authorizes such highways to be used by vehicles with two consecutive sets of tandem and triaxles (tridems) carrying a gross load of 70,000 pounds if the distance between such axles meets certain measurements. Exempts a group of three or more consecutive axles from specified tandem axle requirements. Limits the maximum allowable weight on such specific tandem axle group to 32,000 pounds while allowing 70,000 pounds on the tandem-tridem axle combination.</summary>
