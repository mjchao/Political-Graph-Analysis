  <summary>3/23/1987--Introduced.
Indochinese Refugee Resettlement and Protection Act of 1987 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a specific time period in which the President must consult with the Congress regarding emergency refugee admissions. States that the Secretary of State shall have sole authority to admit certain South Asian refugees. Prohibits denial of refugee status to aliens who are otherwise eligible for immigrant classification. Allocates a specified number of FY 1988 through 1990 refugee admissions for: (1) East Asians; and (2) the Orderly Departure Program (from Vietnam). Expresses the sense of the Congress that under the leadership of the United States renewed efforts should be made to settle Indochinese refugees who have lived in camps for at least three years. Allocates specified numbers of FY 1988 through 1990 East Asian entries for: (1) persons who have lived in refugee camps for at least three years; and (2) other camp residents. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to allocate specified amounts from FY 1988 and 1989 authorizations for education, economic, and military training border projects in Thailand. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the international community should increase efforts to protect Indochinese refugee camps in Thailand from cross-border attacks, and that international personnel should be present on a 24-hour-a-day basis at camp "Site 2" in Thailand.</summary>
