  <summary>12/11/1987--Introduced.
Long Term Care Incentives Package - Title I: Tax Credit for Maintaining a Household for Dependents Who Have Attained Age 65 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow a nonrefundable income tax credit to individuals who maintain a household in which a dependent aged 65 or older resides. Applies the credit to the full amount paid or incurred for maintaining the household for the dependent individual. Reduces the credit (but not below zero) when the taxpayer's gross income exceeds $50,000. Limits the credit to a $100 per month per qualified dependent. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a report detailing the administrative problems and revenue cost in connection with such a credit. Title II: Tax Credit for Contributions to Health Care Savings Account - Amends the IRC to permit individuals (employees or self-employed individuals) and employers to contribute to health care savings accounts. Limits the annual contribution to an amount no greater than the combined employee and employer hospital insurance (Medicare) payroll tax paid during that year. Provides that the employee or self-employed individual and the employer will each receive a 50 percent tax credit for their respective portion of hospital insurance payroll tax paid. Provides that a health care savings account shall be exempt from income taxes, except for the tax on certain unrelated business income, unless the account ceases to be a proper health care savings account because the beneficiary either engages in prohibited transactions or pledges the account as security. Excludes from the gross income of the distributee any amounts distributed from the account as long as they are used for medical expenses while the individual is eligible for Medicare. Permits the tax-free rollover of contributions from one health care savings account to another for the benefit of the distributee. Imposes a ten percent penalty on early distributions from a health care savings account. Provides that no amount distributed out of a health care savings account may be taken as a medical expense deduction. Imposes a tax on any excess contributions to such accounts. Imposes a penalty tax on prohibited transactions involving a health care savings account. Imposes a five percent tax on any distribution from a health care savings account in the taxable year that reduces the level of all such accounts with respect to the distributee below the total value of health care savings account tax credits for the distributee. Provides exceptions for certain distributions. Imposes a 100 percent tax on such distributions if the relevant transactions are not corrected within the taxable period. Imposes a 50 percent excise tax on the difference between the value of a decedent's health care savings account at the time of death and the amount contributed into the spouse's health care savings account at the time of, and on account of, such death. Establishes penalties for failure to file required reports with respect to health care savings accounts. Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide that in the case of an individual who has established a health care savings account, the total amount of any Medicare benefits that will be paid with respect to the individual will be reduced by a health care savings account-related deductible for the year, as described in this Act. Provides special rules for individuals who cannot obtain insurance at the standard premium rates to cover their added deductible. Provides that these high cost insurance beneficiaries' added deductible be reduced by a proportion reflecting 80 percent of the excess premium required above the standard rate, but not below 120 percent of the individual's health care savings account annuity amount. Establishes catastrophic health care expense protection for certain individuals qualifying for Medicare protection. Requires such individuals to have contributed at least one-third of the maximum amount possible over the course of their careers into a health care savings account and at least $100 (indexed for inflation) or 50 percent of the maximum contribution per year, whichever is greater, in ten individual years. Treats surviving spouses without a separate health care savings account as eligible for the catastrophic coverage if the deceased spouse was formerly eligible for catastrophic coverage and the surviving spouse rolls 100 percent of the health care savings account of the deceased spouse into a health care savings account. Title III: Tax Provisions Related to Long-Term Care Insurance - Amends the IRC to require that, for the purpose of determining the income tax liability of life insurance companies, qualified long-term care insurance be treated as accident or health insurance. Applies this provision to policies to provide coverage for at least 12 consecutive months of diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or personal care services required by an individual aged 50 or older and provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. Requires issuers of such insurance to be reinsured by the Federal National Long-term Care Reinsurance Corporation if such Corporation is incorporated as of January 1, 1990. Provides that for the purpose of determining whether a tax exclusion applies to employer contributions to, or an employee's receipt of benefits from, qualified long-term care insurance, such contributions and benefits shall be considered to be for personal injury or sickness and for medical care. Excludes from gross income: (1) amounts withdrawn from an individual retirement plan to pay for long-term care insurance for a distributee who has attained age 59 1/2 by the date of the distribution or for a spouse meeting the same age requirement; and (2) amounts received when an individual aged 65 or older surrenders, cancels, or exchanges a life insurance policy and uses the proceeds to pay for long-term care insurance for himself or herself or for a spouse meeting the same age requirement. Title IV: Federal National Long-Term Care Reinsurance Corporation - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the incorporation of the Federal National Long-Term Care Reinsurance Corporation (Corporation), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the U.S. Government. Requires the Corporation to confine its activities to reinsuring insurance companies for extraordinary loss in the issuance or payment of qualified long-term care insurance benefits. Sets forth organizing and administrative provisions with respect to the Corporation. Exempts the Corporation from State regulation and taxation, except for taxes on real property. Directs the Corporation to report annually to both the President and the Congress regarding its activities.</summary>
