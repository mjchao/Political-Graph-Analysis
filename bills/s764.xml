  <summary>3/18/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 to deny the use of funds provided under such Act for projects using products or services of foreign countries which are listed by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) as not offering reciprocal opportunities for American firms. Requires the USTR to: (1) determine whether each foreign country denies fair and equitable market opportunities for U.S. products and suppliers in procurement, or fair and equitable market opportunities for United States bidders, for construction projects that cost more than $500,000 and are funded by the government of such foreign country; and (2) maintain and publish annually a list of countries for which an affirmative determination is made. Allows an exception to such a denial of funds if the Secretary of Transportation determines: (1) the denial of funds would not be in the public interest; (2) products of the same class or kind are not produced or offered in the United States or in any foreign country not listed by the USTR in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) exclusion of such product or service from the project would increase the cost of the overall project contract by more than 20 percent.</summary>
