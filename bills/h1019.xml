  <summary>2/4/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 to permit the use of education block grant funds for projects for Irish children. Requires that such projects provide an opportunity to live in the United States to children aged ten through 18 from areas of Ireland that have been torn by civil strife and violence. Requires that such opportunity include attendance in U.S. schools and affiliation with children of diverse religious, ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds in a peaceful atmosphere. Permits such funds to be used for such projects if the local educational agency concerned files with the Secretary of Education a plan containing assurances that at least one-half of the cost of such projects will be provided from private donations and that project funds will be used to pay a portion of the cost of such children's round-trip transportation, U.S. schooling, and other living expenses.</summary>
