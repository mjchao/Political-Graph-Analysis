  <summary>6/1/1987--Introduced.
Amends the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act to expand the purposes of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to include the conduct of activities that will benefit fish and wildlife resources of other countries. Limits the expenditure of Federal funds for land acquisition by requiring the acquisition of long-term interests in land and the consent of the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Requires the Foundation to convey such acquisitions to the Director upon request for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Authorizes the Foundation to convey lands to other parties or make grants to other parties for land acquisition if such lands would be protected in perpetuity for fish and wildlife conservation. Authorizes the Foundation, with the consent of the Director, to convey lands for fair market value if they are no longer valuable for conservation purposes. Authorizes the Foundation to reimburse the Secretary of the Interior for administrative expenses. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of the Interior for FY 1988 through 1993 for the Foundation.</summary>
