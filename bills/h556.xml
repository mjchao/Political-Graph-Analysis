  <summary>1/8/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to repeal the requirement that wheat and feed grain producers must plant specified percentages of conserving use acreage in order to receive deficiency payments. Provides a guaranteed three-year contract price for wheat and feed grain producers who agree to devote 100 percent or less of their wheat or feed grain acreage base to conservation use. States that, in the case of a landlord and tenant farmer, price support proceeds shall be shared proportionally to the lease terms in the first year, and paid in full to the landowner for the next two years.</summary>
