  <summary>6/4/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that at the seven-nation economic summit to be held in Venice, Italy: (1) the United States should seek commitments from West Germany and Japan to reduce their trade surpluses by substantially increasing their imports; (2) the United States should seek commitments from the European Community and Japan to liberalize their agricultural import policies; (3) the United States should seek commitments for cooperation to combat and prevent the spread of AIDS; and (4) the President should encourage the Allies at the summit to cooperate in diplomatic and military measures which may be necessary to ensure Western security interests in the Persian Gulf.</summary>
