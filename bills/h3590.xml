  <summary>10/29/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should make the treatment of the Tibetan people an important factor in its conduct of relations with China; (2) the President should meet with the Dalai Lama to discuss efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem; (3) the United States should urge China to reciprocate the Dalai Lama's efforts to establish a dialog over the future status of Tibet; (4) the United States should call attention to the rights of the Tibetan people (as well as other non-Chinese groups in China) and support efforts to maintain Tibet's identity and preserve Tibetan culture and religion; (5) congressional delegations should visit Tibet; and (6) the President should instruct the U.S. ambassadors to China and India to work with the Tibetan people to find areas in which the U.S. Government can be helpful. Requires any notification to the Congress pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act with respect to the sale of arms to China to be accompanied by a presidential determination that the Government of China is acting in good faith and in a timely manner to resolve human rights issues in Tibet. Requires the Secretary of State to submit a report to the Congress on the human rights situation in Tibet and on the transfer of millions of Chinese to Tibet. Provides financial assistance for Tibetan refugees for FY 1988 and 1989. Provides United States Information Agency scholarships for Tibetan exiles for FY 1988 and 1989.</summary>
