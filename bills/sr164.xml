(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #34 (93-0)) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should take appropriate actions under the Trade Act of 1974 to remedy and prevent further violation of the U.S.-Japan agreement on semiconductors by Japan, to induce compliance, to compensate the United States for the harm suffered because of non-compliance by Japan, and to prevent further injury to the United States; (2) such actions should serve to increase international semiconductor trade and help enforce commitments and achieve the objectives of the agreement; (3) such actions should penalize those who have acted inconsistently with the agreement; and (4) such actions may be directed at products which contain semiconductors. Declares that the President should immediately take all appropriate actions to communicate with the Government of Japan to insure the fulfillment of the commitment made by Japan under the terms of the Market Opening Sector Specific telecommunications negotiations for up to 33 percent equity participation by foreign firms in any consortium formed to compete with Kokusai Denshin Denwa.</summary>
