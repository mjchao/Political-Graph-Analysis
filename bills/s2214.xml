Title II: Management of Coastal Plain - Declares that it is congressional policy that oil and gas activities on the Coastal Plain which are conducted with no significant adverse impact upon fish, wildlife, and the environment shall be deemed compatible with the purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and that no further compatibility findings by the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) are required under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Title III: Coastal Plain Competitive Leasing Program - Directs the Secretary to establish and implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for Coastal Plain resources exploration, development, and production.

Prohibits any surface disturbance prior to the publication of final environmental regulations for Coastal Plain oil or gas leasing. Applies such regulations to subsurface property interests owned by the Inupiat Eskimo. Title IV: Coastal Plain Environmental Protection - Directs the Secretary to promulgate environmental protection regulations which ensure that Coastal Plain activities will result in no significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and the environment. Requires site-specific assessment and mitigation. Designates the Sadlerochit Spring area as a special area for wildlife conservation and environmental protection. Authorizes the Secretary to exclude such area from leasing and to designate other Coastal Plain areas as special areas requiring protection. Directs the Secretary to prepare and periodically update a facilities construction and siting plan for oil and gas development and transportation. Authorizes the Secretary to grant rights-of-way and easements across the Coastal Plain in a manner that does not adversely affect fish, wildlife, and the environment.

Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from conducting first lease sales under this Act until 21 months after its date of enactment. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish an Energy Research and Demonstration Grant Program in the areas of energy conservation and alternative energy sources whose focus shall be energy technologies which can significantly reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.
