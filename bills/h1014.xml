  <summary>2/4/1987--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of constructing and operating a canal connecting Lake Ontario and the Erie Canal in the vicinity of Lockport, New York. Requires the study to consider: (1) cost of construction; (2) environmental impact; (3) economic impact on the surrounding region; and (4) the combined effects of the canal connecting Lake Ontario and the Erie Canal and another canal which was the subject of the Study on Lake Erie-Ohio River Canal. Lists the combined effects of the two canals to be studied as: (1) the projected shipping volume on the canal connecting Lake Ontario and the Erie Canal; (2) the projected shipping volume on the canal connecting Lake Erie and the Ohio River; (3) changes in shipping volume on the Welland Canal; and (4) changes in shipping patterns among U.S. and Canadian ports on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Requires the Secretary of the Army to make a report to the Congress within two years.</summary>
