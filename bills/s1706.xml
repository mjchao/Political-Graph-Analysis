  <summary>9/22/1987--Introduced.
Requires that, for the purpose of the income tax deduction for medical expenses, expenditures for the acquisition, training, and maintenance of a service animal used to assist a physically disabled individual (other than a blind or deaf person) be treated in the same manner as corresponding expenditures in connection with guide dogs for the blind or deaf. (Under Internal Revenue Service revenue rulings, these latter expenditures are treated as deductible.)</summary>
