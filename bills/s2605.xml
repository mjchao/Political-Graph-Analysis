(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, S. Rept. 100-469) Refugee Resettlement Extension Act of 1988 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for refugee assistance through FY 1991. Provides for: (1) consolidation of related State administrative procedures; and (2) Federal, State, and local consultation. Transfers responsibility for initial placement policy from the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to the United States Coordinator for Refugee Affairs. Requires the Director to report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding a modified refugee assistance program. Directs the Coordinator to develop a pilot program to reduce welfare dependency among designated refugees through encouragement of resettlement in a community which: (1) is participating in the planned secondary resettlement program; or (2) has a similar program, a small refugee population, or a record of successful refugee resettlement. Grants FY 1990 and 1991 refugee admissions priority to persons whose relatives: (1) are not receiving public assistance; and (2) were recently or currently receiving assistance, previously living in States with high refugee populations, and have moved to resettlement communities. Directs the Coordinator to submit a program report to the appropriate congressional committees within 90 days of the program's termination. Includes within the definition of "designated refugee" for purposes of such program those refugees whose relatives have exceptionally high welfare dependency rates in the Central Valley of California. Directs the Coordinator, together with the Secretaries of State and of Health and Human Services, to issue guidelines for the admission into the United States of refugees for whom private sector funding is available.</summary>
