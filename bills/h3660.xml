  <summary>9/27/1988--Reported to House amended, Part I.
(Reported to House from the Committee on Education and Labor with amendment, H. Rept. 100-985 (Part I)) Act for Better Child Care Services of 1988 - Title I: Better Child Care Services - Makes eligible for services under this title children: (1) who are less than 13 years of age; (2) whose family income does not exceed 115 percent of the State median income for a family of the same size; and (3) who either reside with a parent or parents who are working, seeking employment, or enrolled in a job training or educational program, or reside with a parent or parents not thus described and receive or need to receive protective services. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993 to carry out this title. Reserves specified amounts for certain U.S. territories and possessions and for certain programs for Indian children. Sets forth a formula for allotments to States based on numbers of children under age five, numbers of children eligible for free or reduced price lunches under the school lunch program, and per capita income. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make grants to applicant Indian tribes or tribal organizations for programs and activities under this title for the benefit of Indian children. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether to approve a tribal grant application, to consider: (1) the tribe's codes, regulations, and cultural factors, as well as applicable State licensing and regulatory requirements, in establishing standards for such programs; and (2) the availability of child care services provided by the State in accordance with this title. Requires coordination between tribal and State programs under this title. Includes among lead agency duties the establishment of several local advisory councils that collectively represent the entire geographical area in the State. Sets forth requirements relating to such local advisory councils. Requires States to submit, in order to qualify for assistance under this title, an application and plan to the Secretary. Requires each plan to cover a five-year period and to meet specified requirements for providers of child care services. Requires a plan to provide for: (1) a designated lead agency; (2) a State advisory committee on child care; (3) policies and procedures; (4) distribution of funds; (5) reimbursements; (6) consideration of current funding recipients; (7) a sliding fee scale; (8) parental involvement; (9) enforcement of licensing, registration, and other regulatory requirements; and (10) data collection. Requires the plan to specify that at least 75 percent of the State allotment will be used to provide qualified child care services to eligible children, on a sliding fee scale basis (according to specified funding methods) with priority given to services to children of families with very low incomes for their size. Requires that at least ten percent of such reserved funds be used to provide for the extension of part-day programs.
