(Reported to House from the Committee on Agriculture with amendment, H. Rept. 100-396) Food Stamp Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to make food stamp program (program) eligibility permanent for households made up solely of members who receive aid to dependent children, supplemental security income assistance or aid to the aged, blind, or disabled under the provisions of the Social Security Act. Excludes from income for purposes of program eligibility: (1) educational assistance for training programs and secondary school equivalency programs; (2) child support payments received under the aid to families with dependent children program (AFDC); (3) certain agricultural commodity two-party payments; (4) advance earned income tax credit payments; and (5) dependent care payments received under specified employment and training programs. Sets maximum monthly dependent care deductions at $200 for each dependent under two years old and $175 for each other dependent. (Current deduction is $160 per month regardless of age.) Provides for annualizing self-employment farm income and expenses. Prohibits the use of post self-employment farm income as an indicator of anticipated income if income changes have occurred or are anticipated. Excludes certain property (including land, equipment, and supplies) from financial resources determinations for one year after a person ceases to be self-employed in farming. Permits higher education students living in households receiving food stamps to retain their program benefits under specified conditions. Sets maximum monthly dependent care reimbursements for employment and training program participants at $200 for each dependent under two years old and $175 for each other dependent. Increases individual maximum transportation and related reimbursable employment and training costs. Revises performance standards criteria, including the requirement that the Office of Technology Assessment develop model performance standards. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop an incentives payment proposal. Authorizes: (1) outreach activities for farm households; and (2) special training for personnel who certify farm households. Requires the Secretary to publish training materials annually. Requires State food stamp offices and points of issuance to be open sufficient hours and at sufficient locations to ensure access by participants who work or study. Requires State agencies to insure that each participating household receive a notice of expiration prior to the start of the last month of certification. Requires coordination of applications for program and AFDC benefits. Authorizes a five-year Family Independence Demonstration Project in the State of Washington as an alternative to providing benefits under the food stamp program. Sets forth Project provisions, including: (1) combination of AFDC and program benefits into a basic cash grant; (2) assistance to the homeless; (3) minimum cash assistance for food at not less than program equivalents; (4) outreach services; (5) employment and training requirements; (6) assurances that the State will permit continued program participation; (7) audit and congressional reporting requirements by the Comptroller General of the United States; (8) a Project evaluation requirement by the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and (9) the ineligibility of persons receiving only child care or medical benefits under the Project from receiving Project food assistance (although they may continue to receive program benefits). Authorizes up to ten State projects under the terms and conditions of the Washington Project, except that such projects could not replace food stamps with cash payments. Directs the Secretary to issue implementing rules by January 1, 1988. Provides for the severability of amendments under this Act. Sets forth effective dates.</summary>
