Video and Library Privacy Protection Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a video rental or sales entity or library from: (1) disclosing personally identifiable information about service users; or (2) retaining in a record such information more than one year after certain conditions no longer exist. Sets forth exceptions, including disclosure: (1) to that individual; (2) with that individual's consent; (3) to a law enforcement agency under court order; or (4) when necessary for a legitimate business purpose. Sets forth requirements for the consent exception, including an alternative consent to disclosure which: (1) is limited to the name and address of the user; and (2) the user has been given an opportunity to prohibit. Sets forth requirements for a court order for disclosure to a Federal or State law enforcement agency.
