(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-490) Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 - Title I: Assistance to Farm Credit System Borrowers - Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to provide a five-year guarantee (par value redemption) for the value of Farm Credit System (FCS) borrower held stock. Applies such guarantee to: (1) certain frozen stock; (2) stock outstanding on the date of enactment of this Act; and (3) certain stock required to be purchased in order to obtain an FCS institution (institution) loan. Requires an FCS lender to restructure a financially-stressed loan if the loan's restructured value would exceed its liquidated value. Requires the lender to: (1) notify a borrower of a distressed loan that such loan may be suitable for restructuring, not later than 45 days before beginning any foreclosure action; (2) take no foreclosure action before determining a loan's suitability for restructuring; and (3) choose the least-cost restructuring alternative. Requires each farm credit district (district) board of directors, within 60 days of enactment of this Act, to develop a written policy governing the treatment of distressed loans, including denied borrowers' appeal rights. States that such policy shall constitute the restructuring policy of each FCS lender within the district. Requires each lender to submit semiannual Farm Credit Administration (FCA) reports regarding loan review results and the financial effect of restructurings and foreclosures. Authorizes Federal intermediate credit banks, on request of any production credit association, to assist in loan restructuring. Provides that if a Federal land bank or production credit association writes off restructured loan principal, the borrower's land bank or production credit association shall cancel the equivalent dollar value of the borrower's stock. Entitles the borrower to retain at least one share of stock in order to maintain association membership and voting power. Requires each district to establish a special asset group to review, and reverse if appropriate, loan restructuring denials. Establishes a National Special Asset Council to: (1) monitor lender compliance; and (2) review sample special asset group determinations. Expresses the sense of the Congress that institutions should administer restructuring and other loan guarantee programs on a case-by-case-basis with the objective of using such programs as alternatives to foreclosure. Requires lenders to provide borrowers with access to documents and loan information concerning interest rates, charges, loan options, and any action taken on such loan. Gives distressed loan borrowers the right to request a review of a restructuring denial. Prohibits a lender from accelerating loan payments. Establishes a foreclosed borrower's right of first refusal to FCS-acquired agricultural real estate. Limits such right to the property's previous owner. Sets forth implementing provisions. Requires lenders offering more than one interest rate, upon borrower request, to: (1) review the loan to determine if the proper interest rate has been charged; and (2) explain the basis for such different rates. Applies certain uninsured borrower funds held in a bankrupt institution against such person's loan indebtedness. Title II: Assistance to Farm Credit System - Establishes a federally-chartered Farm Credit System Assistance Board (Board) to: (1) replace the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation; and (2) provide financial (including stock guarantees) and technical assistance to distressed institutions.

Requires such action when book values fall below 75 percent of par value. Authorizes the Board to determine whether a distressed institution may issue preferred stock sufficient to: (1) maintain the value of its stock; and (2) maintain its economic viability. Enumerates the Board's special powers with regard to seriously distressed institutions, including: (1) appointment of a receiver or a conservator; (2) approval of, and power to mandate, institution consolidations; and (3) authority over operating and loan activities. Requires the Board, in coordination with the Financial Assistance Corporation (created by this Act), to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the FCA to establish the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (Corporation) as a federally-chartered FCS institution. States that the Corporation shall carry out a program to provide capital to distressed institutions. Provides that the Corporation's board of directors shall consist of the board of directors of the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation. Directs the Corporation to establish: (1) the Farm Credit Assistance Fund; and (2) the Financial Assistance Corporation Trust Fund. Authorizes the Corporation to issue 15-year debt obligations. Sets forth the following interest payment schedule: (1) the Corporation shall pay full interest for the first five years; (2) the Corporation and the institutions shall split the interest for the second five years; and (3) the institutions shall pay full interest after the first ten years. Makes the Corporation liable for institution interest defaults. States that institutions shall repay the Government for interest costs incurred in their behalf. Requires that such repayments be made: (1) when the institutions possess the necessary financial viability; and (2) in a manner that shall not impair stock or capital requirements. Directs the Corporation to: (1) evaluate institutions as their obligations come due; (2) furnish the Secretary of the Treasury and the appropriate congressional committees with such evaluations; and (3) if an institution is unable to redeem preferred stock, use Trust Fund amounts for such purpose. States that: (1) Treasury funds shall be used if the Corporation is unable to meet interest or principal obligations; and (2) the first $2,000,000,000 of Treasury payments to the Assistance Fund shall not be subject to institution repayment. Authorizes appropriations for restructuring purposes. Provides Trust Fund financing through institution purchases of Corporation stock. Permits district boards, with affected institution approval, to reallocate such required stock purchase assessments. Terminates the Corporation upon debt expiration. Makes the current revolving fund available to assist institutions during the transition period.

Title III: Capitalization of System Institutions - Directs the FCA, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, to establish minimum capitalization standards for FCS institutions. Requires such standards to include fixed capital to asset ratios. Prohibits any institution enforcement actions based solely on capitalization adequacy during the five-year transition period.

States that as of the later of January 1, 1989, or 12 months after enactment of this Act, every FCS bank will be an insured bank. Requires annual premium filings with the Insurance Corporation. Subjects an institution to forfeiture of FCS rights and privileges for failure to file or pay the premiums, and makes a director who participated in such failure personally liable for consequential damages. Authorizes the Insurance Corporation to: (1) make loans to purchase the assets or securities of, assume the liabilities of, or make contributions to a financially troubled insured institution; and (2) take specified steps to facilitate institution mergers or consolidations. Prohibits assistance to an institution if such amounts would exceed liquidation costs, unless the continued operation of the institution is essential to provide local agricultural credit services.
