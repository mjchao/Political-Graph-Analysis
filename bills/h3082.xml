  <summary>8/3/1987--Introduced.
Methanol and Alternative Fuels Promotion Act of 1987 - Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to revise the dual fuel passenger automobile driving range for automobiles operating on certain ethanol or methanol mixtures. Provides that for any ten consecutive model years between 1993 and 2005, a dual fuel passenger automobile manufacturer shall receive an average fuel economy increase according to specified guidelines. Declares that if a manufacturer makes methanol or ethanol powered or dual fuel passenger automobiles, the fuel economy of an automobile shall be based on the fuel content of the methanol or ethanol mixture used to operate it. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the Congress regarding ethanol and methanol promotion. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to declare that the determination of tax to be imposed regarding methanol-, ethanol-, or natural gas-powered or dual fuel passenger automobiles shall be based on the fuel economy rating established under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.</summary>
