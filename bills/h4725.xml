Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Housing Assistance Block Grant Act of 1988 - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to combine the current emergency shelter grant program, the supplemental assistance for facilities to assist the homeless program, and the supportive housing demonstration program into a single homeless housing assistance block grant. Makes such assistance available to States, cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990. Bases allocations on the community development block grant formula. Requires a set-aside for Indian assistance and then allocates remaining funds between cities and urban counties (80 percent) and States (20 percent). Requires grantee compliance with civil rights laws.</summary>
