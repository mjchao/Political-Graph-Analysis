  <summary>3/19/1987--Introduced.
Strategic Ocean and Coastal Resources Act of 1987 - Title I: National Sea Grant College Program - Amends the National Sea Grant College Program Act (the Sea Grant Act) to revise certain findings and definitions under such Act. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to identify those ocean and coastal resources research areas that are to be considered "strategic research areas" for purposes of the making of grants for research in such areas. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, on an annual basis, a report containing the rationale for identifying each strategic research area. Directs the Secretary to make grants to any project that is: (1) within a sea grant program; and (2) involves a strategic research area. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1992 for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary, as part of the sea grant fellowship program, to award sea grant fellowships to support the placement of qualified individuals in positions with the Federal Government for a period of up to one year. Revises provisions concerning the composition and terms of office of the Sea Grant Review Panel. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1992. Directs the Secretary to establish a postdoctoral fellowship program under which grants are made to support strategic research and to provide supplemental education and training in any field related to ocean and coastal resources for which the Secretary considers there to be a national need. Outlines provisions concerning the application for and the awarding of such fellowships. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1992 for such purpose. Amends the Sea Grant Act to direct the Secretary to provide annual grants to enable eligible institutions to improve and support curriculum offerings in marine affairs and resource management at the graduate level, to support graduate students of such studies through scholarships and fellowships, and to increase faculty and staff involvement in such programs. Defines "eligible institution" and sets forth grant application and award provisions. Requires each institution receiving such a grant to report to the Secretary annually and within 90 days after the termination of the grant with regard to the application of grant funds. Authorizes appropriations through FY 1992 for the making of such grants. Title II: International Sea Grant Program - Amends the Sea Grant Program Improvement Act of 1976 to include as objectives under such Act various goals which stress the need for international cooperation, technology transfer, and data exchange between the United States and foreign nations with regard to research and educational activity on important marine resources. Extends the authorization of appropriations under such Act through FY 1992.</summary>
