  <summary>10/18/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Montana Natural Resources Protection and Utilization Act of 1988 - Designates specified lands in the following national forests in Montana as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: (1) Beaverhead National Forest; (2) Bitterroot National Forest; (3) Deerlodge National Forest; (4) Lolo National Forest; (5) Custer National Forest; (6) Helena National Forest; (7) Flathead National Forest; (8) Kootenai National Forest; (9) Lewis and Clark National Forest; and (10) Gallatin National Forest. Incorporates the Great Bear Wilderness Area and the Scapegoat Wilderness Area into the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Montana shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases from further review by the Department of Agriculture certain National Forest System lands in Montana which were reviewed in the RARE II program and in the unit plans and the plan for the Beaverhead National Forest which were in effect before completion of RARE II, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases such lands that have been reviewed and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of National Forest System lands in Montana without express congressional authorization. States that such provisions shall also apply to National Forest System lands in Montana which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Designates the following specified areas to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as part of the National Forest System: (1) the West Pioneers National Recreation Area in the Beaverhead National Forest; (2) the Mount Helena National Education and Recreation Area in the Helena National Forest; (3) the Hyalite National Education and Recreation Area in the Gallatin National Forest; (4) the Ross Creek Cedars National Recreation Area in the Kootenai National Forest; (5) the Gibson Reservoir National Recreation Area in the Lewis and Clark National Forest; and (6) the Cottonwood Lake National Recreation Area in the Deerlodge National Forest. Requires the Secretary to manage the Mount Helena and the Hyalite National Education and Recreation Areas with a focus on education and on natural resources protection and management. Requires the Elkhorns National Recreation and Wildlife Area, and the Helena and Deerlodge National Forests to be managed as a national recreation area that emphasizes enhancement of big game habitat. Requires the completion of specified studies for the Gallatin National Forest, the Lewis and Clark National Forest, and the Custer National Forest. Withdraws all federally-owned lands in the Blackfeet Unit from all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the mining and public land laws, and disposition under the geothermal and mineral leasing laws for three years after enactment of this Act. Urges the National Forest Service and the Blackfeet Tribe to prepare a joint land management plan for such area. Authorizes the Secretary to exchange lands and interests in lands with the Plum Creek Timber Company, Incorporated, according to specified terms. Declares the sense of Congress that the exchange of lands in the Porcupine Area should be completed within 90 days after enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for the exchange of lands in the Gallatin National Forest. Authorizes the Secretary to exchange mineral interests with the Burlington National Railroad Company, as specified. Declares it is Congress' policy that the National Forest Service acquire and maintain a reasonable public access to National Forest System lands in Montana. Directs the Secretary to study a potential horse trail in the Swan Range, Flathead National Forest. Redesignates the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Wilderness as the Rattlesnake National Education and Recreation Area and Wilderness. Declares that Congress has sufficiently reviewed the suitability for wilderness designation of the Bitter Creek Wilderness Study Area and the Axolotl Lakes Wilderness Study Area. Releases such areas from the requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that they be managed in a manner that does not impair such suitability. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study for a potential Alpine Running and Bicycle Trail in the Gallatin National Forest. Declares that the Congress expects the National Forest Service to proceed with a timber sale program on the Three Rivers Ranger District of the Kootenai National Forest for FY 1989. Provides that sales awarded prior to March 1, 1988, shall not be subject to further administrative or judicial review. Authorizes appropriations. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should instruct the Secretaries of State, of Commerce, of Defense, and of the Treasury to: (1) consult with allied governments on the impact on Western security of private and public sector credit flows and debt reschedulings to the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact countries, Cuba, Vietnam, Libya, and Nicaragua; and (2) call for a multi-lateral voluntary initiative to end united, general purpose lending to such countries for reasons of national security and prudent commercial banking. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) it condemns the continued suppression of human rights and violations of the Esquipulas II accord by the Sandinistas and calls upon all those who seek peace in Central America to join in such condemnation; (2) the United States should respond in specified ways to such violations; (3) the Sandinista regime and Nicaraguan people should understand that if the Sandinistas comply with democratization, that the United States should respond by lifting the economic embargo against Nicaragua; and (4) the Sandinista regime should understand that continued failure to comply with such accord will cause Congress to approve additional military assistance for the Nicaraguan Resistance. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States: (1) recognizes the desire of the Chilean people for the restoration of a civilian government based on democracy; (2) commends the Government and Armed Forces of Chile for conducting a free and fair plebiscite; (3) calls upon such government to hold free and fair presidential elections in 1989; and (4) encourages all efforts toward reaching full democracy.</summary>
