  <summary>8/11/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions for grants to professional or graduate institutions under title III part B provisions for strengthening historically Black colleges and universities. Repeals the requirement that professional or graduate institutions eligible for such grants be "independent" (thus allowing State-affiliated institutions to qualify). Adds to the list of institutions specifically eligible for such grants: (1) Thurgood Marshall School of Law (at Texas Southern University); (2) North Carolina Central University School of Law; (3) Southern University School of Law (in Louisiana); and (4) Florida A&amp;M College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Graduate Program).</summary>
