  <summary>12/15/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Senate should consider the following reservations to the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles: (1) authorization for the United States to cease compliance with the Treaty if, within 36 months after its entry into force, the President determines that the Soviet Union has violated it, denying the United States the essential benefits of the Treaty; and (2) authorization for the United States to take appropriate measures to protect vital national interests, including redevelopment of Pershing II and ground launched cruise missiles, if the President makes such a determination after such 36-month period. Expresses the sense of the House that if the Senate ratifies the treaty, the Senate should do so with the understanding that the President would, at specified intervals, report to the Congress on Soviet compliance.</summary>
