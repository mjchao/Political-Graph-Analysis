Lumbee Recognition Act - Extends Federal recognition to the Lumbee Indian Tribe of North Carolina. Makes the Tribe and its members eligible for all services and benefits provided to Indians because of their status as federally recognized Indians except that members of the Tribe shall not be entitled to such services until funds have been appropriated for such purposes. Deems members of the Tribe residing in Robeson and adjoining counties to be resident on or near an Indian reservation for purposes of the delivery of such services. Directs the Secretary of the Interior: (1) upon verification of a tribal role, to develop a determination of needs and a budget required to provide services to eligible members of the Tribe; and (2) to request appropriations for such funds as part of the first budget request submitted to the Congress after the fiscal year in which the tribal roll is verified. Directs the Lumbee Indians to organize for their common welfare and to adopt a constitution and bylaws. Directs the Secretary to assist the Tribe in the drafting of a constitution and bylaws, the conduct of an election with respect to such constitution, and the reorganization of the Government of the Tribe under any such constitution and bylaws. Declares that, until the Tribe adopts a constitution, the membership of the Tribe shall consist (subject to review by the Secretary) of every individual who is named in the tribal membership roll that is in effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Requires the State of North Carolina to exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Indian country with respect to the Tribe. Makes such Tribe eligible for certain agricultural loans to acquire land within reservations with respect to lands within the exterior boundaries of Robeson and adjoining counties, North Carolina. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
