  <summary>2/26/1987--Introduced.
Constitutional Amendment - Declares that the authorization by the United States or any State of equal access to the use of public school facilities by student voluntary religious groups shall not constitute an establishment of religion. Declares that nothing in the Constitution shall be construed to prohibit a moment of silence for individual or group silent prayer or reflection in public schools. Prohibits the United States or any State from requiring any person to participate in such prayer or to encourage any particular form of prayer or reflection.</summary>
