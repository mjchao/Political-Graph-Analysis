  <summary>8/10/1988--Introduced.
Save American Jobs Act of 1988 - Requires an employer to notify the Secretary of Labor at least 120 days before an intended relocation of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within such a site, from the United States to a foreign country. Defines "employer" as any business enterprise that employs: (1) 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or (2) 50 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 2,000 hours per week (excluding overtime). Subjects employers who violate such requirement to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each day of such violation, but authorizes the Secretary to reduce such amount for just cause shown. Directs the Secretary to: (1) compile a semiannual list of all employers that carry out such relocations; and (2) distribute such list to all Federal agencies (i.e. executive agencies and military departments). Makes an employer who appears on such list ineligible for any direct or indirect Federal grant or guaranteed loan for five years after the date of the list's publication. Authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with the Federal agency providing a loan or grant, to waive such ineligibility requirement if the applying employer demonstrates that a lack of such loan or grant would: (1) threaten national security; (2) result in a substantial job loss in the United States; or (3) harm the environment. Directs each Federal agency head, when awarding a civilian or defense-related contract, to give preference to a U.S. employer that does not appear on such list. Declares that no provision of this Act shall be construed to permit withholding or denial of payments, compensation, or benefits under any other Federal law (including Federal unemployment compensation, disability payments, or worker retraining or readjustment funds) to workers employed by employers that relocate in a foreign country.</summary>
