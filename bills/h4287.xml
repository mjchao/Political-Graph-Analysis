  <summary>3/29/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a 300 percent excise tax on amounts received by a communication services provider from any telephone subscriber in payment of any charge to prevent a phone connection to a "dial-it service" (service that permits multiple callers to listen to a message or to talk with other callers through a central connection). Prohibits the pass-through of the tax to ratepayers.</summary>
