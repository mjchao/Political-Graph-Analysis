  <summary>6/30/1988--Introduced.
Transgenic Animal Regulatory Reform Act - Title I: Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee - Establishes a Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee within the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. States that the Committee: (1) shall carry out its functions under the supervision of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and (2) shall have no authority to review Federal agency regulatory decisions regarding genetically-engineered animals. Title II: USDA Regulation of the Use of Genetically-Engineered Animals - Prohibits the use of a genetically-engineered animal in agricultural activity without a permit issued by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires an applicant to demonstrate that the proposed activity does not constitute an unreasonable risk to human health, welfare, or the environment. Authorizes the Secretary, in issuing a permit, to restrict the quantity, use, or containment of such animals as necessary. Exempts the following from regulation under this title: (1) animals used in biomedical research or for the production of drugs and for which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has established a system of controls; (2) animals released into the wild and for which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a system of controls; and (3) any substance subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Authorizes the Administrator of EPA to establish such controls. Sets forth conditions and requirements for: (1) initial use permits; and (2) expended use permits; and (3) commercial permits. Directs the Secretary to establish a Transgenic Animal Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on permit applications. Directs the Secretary to report every six months to the Congress and the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee regarding permit applications. Subjects violators of this title or related regulations to specified penalties under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Title III: Miscellaneous - Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act to include genetically-engineered animals under the coverage of such Acts.</summary>
