Requires the Attorney General to report annually, not later than December 31, on the number and types of these certificates during the preceding fiscal year, along with an analysis of the law enforcement effectiveness of their issuance. Includes confidentiality provisions with respect to records, authorizing an aggrieved person to bring a civil action against violators. Authorizes the Attorney General to prescribe necessary regulations to govern reporting and recordkeeping. Lists criteria to be met by any such regulations, including a one-year limitation on any regulation's effectiveness. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to require importers and exporters of listed chemicals to notify the Attorney General of importations or exportations within 15 days before the transaction in question. Provides for exceptions with respect to transactions with regular business customers of the regulated person, if the relationship is reported to the Attorney General. Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action for injunctive relief with respect to such importation or exportation of a listed chemical to be used in violation of such Act. Requires written notice justifying such an order. Entitles the affected regulated person to a hearing, if requested. Applies civil penalties to persons who fail to meet notification requirements, unless the failure is intentional, in which case criminal penalties apply. Lists the precursor chemicals and essential chemicals regulated under this Act. Describes transactions exempted from reporting and recordkeeping requirements, including certain lawful distributions in the usual course of business between agents or employees of a single regulated person and transactions involving listed chemicals contained in a drug lawfully marketable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to apply criminal penalties to persons who knowingly or intentionally: (1) possess a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance; (2) possess or distribute a chemical having reasonable cause to believe that it will be used for such a purpose; (3) distribute a listed chemical unlawfully; or (4) possess listed chemicals with knowledge that recordkeeping or reporting requirements have not been met and fail to remedy the violation. Authorizes as an additional penalty an injunction preventing any person convicted of a felony violation of controlled substances laws regarding listed chemicals from engaging in any regulated transaction involving a listed chemical for up to ten years. Amends sections of the Controlled Substances Act that describe prohibited acts and penalties to account expressly for new violations instituted in this subtitle.

Repeals provisions authorizing transfers of excess Fund monies to the Building and Facilities Account of the Federal Prison System. Authorizes the Attorney General to exempt certain contract services from specified advertising and procurement requirements if necessary to maintain the security and confidentiality of an investigation. Decreases the percentage of program-related use required in connection with automatic data processing equipment purchased or leased with Fund monies. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to exempt conveyances from forfeiture for drug abuse violations, to the extent of the interest of an owner who did not know of or consent to the relevant unlawful act or omission. Directs the Attorney General to assure that equitable sharing principles are applied with respect to property transferred to a State or local law enforcement agency that participated directly in the seizure or forfeiture. Instructs the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and maintain a joint plan to coordinate and consolidate post-seizure administration of property seized under controlled substances laws. Title III: State and Local Assistance - State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 1988 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to earmark five percent of funds appropriated to the Bureau of Justice Statistics for grants to States and to local governments to improve the accuracy and completeness of criminal history information. Transfers responsibility for the appointment of the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (Bureau) from the Attorney General to the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.
