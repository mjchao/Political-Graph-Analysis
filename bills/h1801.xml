Amends both the Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to transfer responsibility for the administration of Children's Justice Act programs from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the Office for Victims of Crime. Requires the Attorney General, acting through the Director, to use specified funds to make grants to the States to assist them in developing, establishing, and operating programs to improve: (1) the handling of child abuse cases, particularly cases of child sexual abuse, so as to limit additional trauma to the child victim; and (2) the investigation and prosecution of cases of child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse. Requires the Director, in consultation with representatives of the Department of HHS and other Federal agencies, to develop an annual proposed plan describing criteria for selecting programs for such grants, and to provide such plan report to the appropriate congressional committees. Sets forth eligibility requirements for States to quality for such grant assistance. Requires applicant States to establish or designate a State multidisciplinary task force on children's justice composed of professionals with knowledge and experience relating to the criminal justice system and issues of child abuse. Sets forth requirements for State task force studies and for adoption of State task force recommendations. Authorizes the Attorney General, acting through the Director, to use up to 15 percent of such grant funds to assist Native American Indian tribes in carrying out such programs to improve the handling, investigation, and prosecution of child abuse cases. Requires the Director to include a summary of States funded under such grants program and program results when reporting to the President and the Congress under the Act. Chapter 3: Other Amendments to Victims of Crime Act of 1984 - Revises provisions for assistance to State programs of compensation to victims of violent crimes and their survivors. Requires that victims and survivors of victims of drunk driving and domestic violence be included among those to whom such assisted programs offer compensation. Prohibits such assisted programs from denying compensation to any victim because of a familial relationship with the offender or because the victim lived with the offender at the time of the crime, but allows the program to establish reasonable regulations, pursuant to Department of Justice guidelines, to prevent the unjust enrichment of the offender. Adds provisions regarding compensation for eyeglasses or other corrective lenses.</summary>
