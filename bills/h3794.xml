  <summary>12/18/1987--Introduced.
Worker's Option Act of 1988 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to phase out, by 1993, the limitation on the amount of outside income which beneficiaries who have attained retirement age may earn without incurring a reduction in benefits. Increases the delayed retirement credit rate for individuals who work beyond retirement age. Phases out the recomputation of an individual's primary insurance amount when such individual has wages or self-employment income after entitlement to old-age or disability insurance benefits. Charges off an individual's excess earnings by eliminating such individual's entitlement to retroactive OASDI benefits for months preceding such individual's attainment of retirement age. Authorizes the appropriation of revenues received by reason of this Act's amendments to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund from 1989 through 1993.</summary>
