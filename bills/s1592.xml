  <summary>8/5/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal law relating to maximum speed limits on any public highway to direct the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove State highway projects seeking Federal proportional contribution if: (1) such highways have a maximum speed limit in any urbanized area (currently, any State public highway) exceeding 55 miles an hour; and (2) the maximum speed limit on any other public highway (other than a rural Interstate Highway) in the requesting State exceeds 65 miles per hour. Directs the Secretary to reduce the Federal-aid highway funds apportioned to a State if data submitted by such State indicates that the percentage of motor vehicles exceeding 55 miles an hour in any urbanized area (currently, any area) is greater than 50 percent.</summary>
