  <summary>8/4/1988--Introduced.
Spectrum Assignment Improvements Act of 1988 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use competitive bidding in awarding licenses or construction permits for unassigned spectrum in specified frequency bands, except in connection with public safety or amateur radio services or mass communications. Permits these value-based assignments when there are or are likely to be mutually exclusive applicants. Prescribes procedures to govern the bidding process, including a requirement that the applicant make initial payment of its bid before the license or permit is granted, with the monies to be deposited in the Treasury. Directs the FCC to adopt rules establishing this bidding process within one year of this Act's enactment. Requires the FCC to report annually to the Congress on the use and effectiveness of the new authority, which expires five years after enactment. Excepts licensee selections under this Act from judicial review.</summary>
