  <summary>10/14/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the actions of the Soviet Union in testing ballistic missiles near Hawaii and irradiating U.S. monitoring aircraft are provocative, unnecessary, and inconsistent with behavior designed to reduce the risk of nuclear war. Declares that the U.S. Government should officially protest such actions and should seek Soviet assurances that such missile testing near U.S. territory and irradiation of U.S. aircraft will not occur in the future. States that the President should report to the Congress concerning the details of such tests, the Soviet explanations offered, and steps that will be taken to ensure that such activities will not happen in the future.</summary>
