Estuarine and Coastal Waters Study and Protection Act - Directs the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to jointly develop and implement a national estuarine and coastal waters program which includes an ongoing evaluation of water quality and resource management, particularly as they have been affected by pollution. Requires such program to provide technical assistance to other government agencies in developing and implementing resource management and water quality projects and strategies. Directs the Administrators to jointly issue regulations identifying functions of their respective agencies and how such functions will be coordinated under the applicable environmental laws. Requires the Administrators to jointly designate one or more centers for estuarine and coastal studies to provide research, information collection and dissemination, educational programs, and technical assistance. Directs the Administrators to report biennially to the Congress on Federal activities undertaken to improve water quality and resource management, a ranking of degraded waters, and a discussion of major pollution problems and the research and management needed. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
