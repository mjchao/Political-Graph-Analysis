  <summary>3/18/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the North Korean regime should: (1) take steps to cease its political repression and denial of human rights; (2) end its involvement and support for international terrorism; (3) end its efforts to sustain a first-strike military advantage over the Republic of Korea; (4) seek to ease tensions on the Peninsula by the resumption of the stalled North-South negotiations; and (5) consider other steps to ease tensions between North and South, including superpower cross-recognition of the two Korean governments, simultaneous entry of North and South into the United Nations, and a commitment by North Korea to participate in the 1988 Seoul Olympic games.</summary>
