  <summary>3/30/1988--Introduced.
Requires that products which contain, are produced with, or are produced from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) be labeled with a specified warning that CFCs destroy the ozone layer which increases the risk of skin cancer and disrupts natural systems, including food production. Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate regulations, within three months of the date of enactment of this Act, requiring the label to be prominently placed visible to retail purchasers. Provides that a product not labeled in accordance with this Act shall be considered a misbranded hazardous substance subject to the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and a specified penalty.</summary>
