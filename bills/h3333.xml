  <summary>9/22/1987--Introduced.
Telecommunications Equipment Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 1987 - Prohibits a Bell operating company from selling or leasing in interstate commerce any telecommunications or customer premises equipment manufactured by any Bell operating company, unless such equipment was manufactured in the United States. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) be responsible for the enforcement of this Act; (2) prescribe regulations to prevent shortages of telecommunications equipment; and (3) submit annual reports to certain congressional committees on the state of the Nation's domestic telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry. Authorizes the Secretary to bring an action against any Bell operating company violating this Act. Limits the civil penalties a U.S. district court may impose for such violation. Requires the Federal Communications Commission, in determining whether any charge, practice, classification, or regulation of any common carrier is reasonable, to exclude from the cost of providing the service in question the costs of procurement of any telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment not manufactured in the United States.</summary>
