  <summary>10/27/1987--Introduced.
National Security Reform Act of 1987 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to prohibit the approval, conduct, or funding of covert operations (other than those intended solely for obtaining necessary intelligence) by or on behalf of the executive branch, until the President makes a finding that each such covert operation is important to national security. Requires that each finding be immediately reduced to writing and signed by the President, except that the President may make such finding orally in an emergency affecting vital U.S. interests. Requires the oral finding to be reduced to writing within 24 hours. Provides that a finding shall be effective only with respect to operations beginning after the finding was made. Requires the President to contemporaneously, but in no event later than 24 hours after the making of a written finding, inform the intelligence committees of any such finding. Allows the President to limit such notification, under extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests, to oral notice to the chairman and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. Makes the knowing deception of the Congress, or of any committee or subcommittee, a crime punishable by imprisonment for one to five years and a fine of up to $10,000. Allows an individual to avoid liability by notifying in writing the committee or subcommittee of any violation and providing the truthful information in its place within five days. Establishes an Office of the Inspector General within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Requires the President to appoint an Inspector General who shall report to and be under the supervision of only the Director of Central Intelligence or the officer next below in rank. Allows the Director to prohibit the Inspector General from conducting any audit or investigation, or from issuing any subpoena, only concerning ongoing operations and only if such action is necessary to protect vital national security interests. Requires the Director to submit a classified statement to the intelligence committees justifying such action within seven days. Permits the Inspector General to be removed from office only by the President, and requires that the President immediately notify both Houses of Congress in writing of the reasons for any such removal. Includes among the duties of the Inspector General: (1) to conduct investigations and audits to assure that CIA operations are conducted efficiently and in accordance with applicable law and regulations; and (2) to keep the Director and the Congress informed concerning violations, abuses, deficiencies, and corrective actions. Directs the Inspector General to submit a classified semiannual report on his activities to the Director, who shall transmit such report to the intelligence committees. Requires the Inspector General to report serious problems, violations of law or regulations, or serious deficiencies relating to the administration of CIA programs and operations, immediately. Requires the Director to transmit any such report to the intelligence committees within seven days.</summary>
