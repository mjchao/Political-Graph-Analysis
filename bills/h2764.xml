  <summary>6/24/1987--Introduced.
Requires the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive study into: (1) the use of potentially unfair, deceptive, or misleading practices in the marketing and sale of insurance to the elderly, including the marketing and sale of Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) supplemental health insurance, and the effectiveness of State and Federal efforts to combat such practices; (2) the relationship of the premiums for such health insurance to the claims paid; (3) the effect on such health insurance of Medicare or catastrophic health care legislation enacted in the 100th Congress; and (4) the appropriateness of extending the standards imposed on Medicare supplemental health insurance policies to other health insurance policies. Requires the Commission to report the results of such study to the Congress within one year of this Act's enactment.</summary>
