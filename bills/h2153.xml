  <summary>4/23/1987--Introduced.
Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a State's plan to provide for payment for the reservation of a bed in a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility for an individual to accommodate the individual's temporary absence (other than for hospitalization) from the facility, if: (1) immediately before the absence the individual is receiving medical assistance under the plan for inpatient services furnished in the facility; (2) the individual's plan of care provides for these absences; and (3) the absences do not total more than 15 days in any 12-month period. Prohibits a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility from participating in Medicaid unless it agrees to provide for such reservation of beds. Sets certain restrictions on payments for unused beds.</summary>
