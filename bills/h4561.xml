Directs the Administrator to undertake activities to maximize the commercial use of space, including: (1) promoting joint endeavor agreements and ensuring the availability of flight opportunities for commercial users; (2) charging space shuttle launch prices for commercial and foreign users in accordance with established law; and (3) ensuring that the civil space program is conducted so as to facilitate the commercialization of activities in space, expand opportunities to realize potential benefits of space activities, and use the expertise and creativity of interested parties. Directs the Administrator: (1) before October 1, 1992, to increase the request for aeronautical research and technology development and validation activities to 15 percent of the total NASA budget; (2) in FY 1989 through 1993, to engage in specified aeronautical research and technology development activities, including the maintenance and enhancement of a complement of national facilities for carrying out these activities; and (3) to increase the number of full-time civil service personnel engaged in these activities by 50 percent over the 1989 level. Directs the Administrator to: (1) encourage the practical application of technologies developed through NASA activities; (2) seek to expand the Industrial Applications Centers network system; and (3) contract for implementation of the Industrial Applications Center in Oklahoma. Requires the Administrator, for FY 1989 through 1993, to develop a plan for necessary facilities construction. Requires the Administrator to report economic assumptions and specified facility and fiscal estimates to specified congressional committees by January 15, 1989. Title II: 3-Year Authorization - Authorizes FY 1989 through 1991 appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for specified activities relating to: (1) research and development; (2) space flight, control, and data communications; (3) construction of facilities; and (4) research and program management, including scientific consultations. Permits appropriations for the first two categories to be used for certain items of a capital nature (other than land acquisition) required for the performance of research and development contracts, and for grants to nonprofit research organizations to augment their research facilities. Prohibits the use of these funds for the construction of any major facility whose estimated cost exceeds $500,000, unless the Administrator of NASA notifies specified congressional leadership and committees. Permits upward variances of funds for facilities construction under circumstances outlined in this Act. Authorizes certain fund transfers and makes available specified funds for the construction and modification of laboratories and other installations. Requires the Administrator to notify specified congressional leadership and committees of the nature, cost, and need for such construction before expending the funds in question. Prohibits, until 30 days following congressional receipt of the Administrator's full explanation, the use of funds appropriated pursuant to this Act for any program that: (1) has been eliminated by the Congress; (2) is in excess of the amount actually authorized for the particular program (except for construction of facilities); or (3) has not been presented to either of the relevant congressional committees. Declares it to be the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest to consider the widest geographical distribution, whenever feasible, in allotting Federal research funds and that NASA should explore ways to do so. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to authorize certain NASA-related personnel to make warrantless arrests, under limited circumstances, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Administrator and approved by the Attorney General. Establishes the National Mars Commission to: (1) develop a strategy for international cooperation on unmanned Mars projects, including safeguards against unwanted transfers of technology; and (2) prepare a detailed proposal for a cooperative manned Mars mission with the Soviet Union and any other interested nations. Details membership and administrative features of the Commission. Directs the Commission, six months after this Act's enactment, to prepare and submit to both the President and the Congress: (1) a report outlining preliminary cooperative strategies with respect to both independent unmanned Mars projects and a joint manned mission with the Soviet Union and any other interested nations; and (2) a final proposal for a joint manned Mars mission by participating countries. Terminates the Commission 30 days following the submission of its final report. Authorizes the Administrator to initiate procedures for competitive procurement of a commercially developed microgravity research space facility to be placed in orbit by the end of FY 1993. Requires the Administrator to: (1) report a final selection and related details regarding such a facility to specified congressional committees no later than the date when the President submits the NASA FY 1990 budget request; and (2) keep the committees informed of activities and negotiations relating to the microgravity research facility. Requires the express authorization of the Congress before the Administrator may sign any contract for the acquisition of such a facility. Prescribes conditions that must apply in connection with the authorization of funding for and the maintenance and utilization of such a facility. Directs the Administrator to: (1) contract with the National Academy of Sciences to review the microgravity research capability of the United States and issue a report addressing specified issues with respect to a commercially developed space facility; (2) contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to consider various features associated with Government costs that might be associated with such a facility; and (3) report to specified congressional committees, no later than February 1, 1989, on topics relating to a commercially developed space facility and microgravity facilities.
