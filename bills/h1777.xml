  <summary>12/14/1987--Conference report filed in House.
(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-475) Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 - Title I: The Department of State - Part A: Authorization of Appropriations; Allocations of Funds; Restrictions - Authorizes appropriations to the Department of State (the Department) for: (1) administration of foreign affairs (including diplomatic and ongoing operations, the diplomatic security program, and diplomatic security program capital construction); (2) international organizations; (3)) international peacekeeping activities; (4) international conferences and contingencies; (5) international commissions; (6) migration and refugee assistance; and (7) other programs, including bilateral science and technology agreements and Soviet-East European research and training. Provides for reduction in earmarked amounts if appropriations are less than authorizations. Provides, with specified limitations, for transfers of funds to salaries and expenses from certain capital program funds. Requires compliance with the presidential-congressional summit agreement on deficit reduction. Prohibits use of foreign affairs funds for political purposes. Directs the Secretary of State (the Secretary) to use specified funds for FY 1988 and 1989 to establish a Latin America and Caribbean Data Base. Part B: Department of State Authorities and Activities; Foreign Missions - Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to prohibit the reprogramming of appropriated State Department funds during the last 15 days in which such funds are available (unless notice of such reprogramming is made before such period). Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this or any other Act to pay expenses related to: (1) the closing of any U.S. mission or consulate abroad; or (2) the Bureau of Administration of the Department or any of its functions if any U.S. consulate or mission is closed after January 1, 1987, and not reopened. Provides for exceptions from such prohibition when: (1) a host government will not allow the post to be reopened; (2) a post is closed because of a break or downgrading of diplomatic relations; (3) there is a threat to personnel; or (4) it is reported that a new higher priority post is to receive the funds for the post proposed to be closed. Authorizes the Secretary to submit a report proposing a list of posts to be downgraded or closed in the event of a sequestration order under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Allocates specified funds for FY 1988 and 1989 to operate certain consulates. Prohibits the use of Department funds for the expenses of maintaining a diplomatic or consular post in Antigua and Barbuda. Allows a presidential waiver of such prohibition on national security grounds. Directs the Secretary to provide a quarterly report to specified congressional committees on expenditures made from the appropriations for Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service. Prohibits the expenditures of gift funds for representational purposes at U.S. missions except in accordance with the conditions that apply to appropriated funds. Directs the Secretary to administer the historic and artistic furnishings of the reception areas of the Department of State Building by such means and measures as to conform to the fundamental purpose of such museum areas. Authorizes the Secretary, with the advice and concurrence of the Director of the National Gallery of Art, to sell items which are not needed and to trade or purchase articles for such museum areas. Authorizes the Secretary to obtain insurance for such historic and artistic furnishings. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that the Secretary's annual report on human rights practices in foreign countries includes information on coercive population control. Requires that such information be provided wherever applicable. Prohibits a foreign mission from allowing an unaffiliated alien to use its premises for any purpose, including residence, incompatible with its status as a foreign mission. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prohibition after notifying specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on implementation of this prohibition, and to submit other reports on such implementation as necessary.
