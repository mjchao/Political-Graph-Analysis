Requires the Secretary to provide for periodic inspections during the construction or renovation of any mass transportation facility to ensure compliance with approved plans, specifications, estimates, and local building codes. Requires the Administrator of General Services to: (1) inspect renovated or constructed facilities at least once every five years to determine safety conditions; and (2) report the results of each such inspection to the Secretary and to the public.</summary>
