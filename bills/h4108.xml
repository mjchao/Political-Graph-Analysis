  <summary>3/8/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require a domestic building and loan association to include in its gross income any assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation in excess of $200,000,000 in connection with reorganizations of financially troubled thrift institutions. Revises a special rule pertaining to certain loss carryforwards and built-in losses following an ownership change in title 11 (Bankruptcy) or similar cases involving financial institutions. Disallows application of the rule when it is reasonable to expect that FSLIC assistance exceeding $200,000,000 will be associated with the ownership change.</summary>
