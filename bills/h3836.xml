  <summary>12/22/1987--Introduced.
Nuclear Waste Transportation Act of 1987 - Amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to add a new Subtitle B: Transportation of High Level Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel, to provide that a package design shall be selected by the Secretary of Transportation only after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has certified that physical tests on full scale models demonstrate the package design's compliance with the Commission's safety criteria. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year of the date of enactment of this Act on whether foreign package design safety standards should be adopted in the United States. Directs the NRC to conduct public hearings on the adequacy of the design standards and tests for packages used in radioactive waste transportation. Requires the Secretary to: (1) promulgate regulations that encourage the transportation of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by rail and discourage the transportation of such materials by truck; and (2) establish a licensing program for all persons involved in radioactive waste transportation. Prescribes application procedures, including a requirement for an emergency response and mitigation plan outlining procedures for the unintended release of radioactive waste. Requires the Secretary to prepare an environmental assessment prior to issuing a radioactive waste transportation license. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a radioactive waste transportation route through an area designated by the Bureau of the Census as an urbanized area if local officials of the affected area recommend a significantly safer route. Authorizes the States and Indian tribes to impose regulations regarding radioactive waste transportation through their jurisdictions. Prescribes deadlines for the Secretary's prompt response to license applications. States that funding for activities under this Act shall be derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund.</summary>
