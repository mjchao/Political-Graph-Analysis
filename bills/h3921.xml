Amends the Small Business Act with respect to breakout procurement center representatives. Removes restrictions on the technical data and procurement records available to such representatives, providing access to certain restricted and classified materials. Revises appeals procedures in connection with a representative's appeal of failure to act favorably on his or her recommendations. Revises the definition of "major procurement center" to include entities other than centers of the Department of Defense and to permit the Administrator of the Small Business Administration discretion in determining eligible centers. Adds the following as duties of breakout procurement center representatives: (1) to conduct familiarization sessions for contracting officers and other appropriate personnel of the assigned procurement center; and (2) to prepare and personally deliver an annual briefing and report to the head of the procurement center.
