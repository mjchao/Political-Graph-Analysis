  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Prohibits an executive agency from starting or conducting any commercial activity in the agency to provide goods or services for the agency if such goods or services can be procured from any responsive and responsible profitmaking business concern. Makes an exception to such prohibition if the head of the agency determines that there is a clearly identified and demonstrated economic advantage to start or conduct such activity. Allows the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe additional limited exceptions when appropriate to protect Federal interest. Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act.</summary>
