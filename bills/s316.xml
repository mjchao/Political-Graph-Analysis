  <summary>1/16/1987--Introduced.
Acid Deposition and Sulfur Emissions Reduction Act- Amends the Clean Air Act to designate an acid deposition impact region comprising a long-range transport corridor of 31 States and the District of Columbia. Requires States from such region to develop and submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an emissions limitation compliance schedule for sulfur dioxide from fossil fuel fired electric utility steam generating units, other units, and total units. Requires a two-phase reduction in such emissions, the first to be achieved by 1993, the second by the end of 1997. Requires each State to develop and submit to the Administrator a plan to achieve nitrogen oxides emissions reductions from fossil fuel fired steam generating units by the end of 1997. Directs the Acid Precipitation Task Force to implement an accelerated research program during the first stage to examine the pattern of effects of atmospheric loading of pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Requires the Administrator to study air pollution problems associated with the long-range transport of pollutants in nonregion States. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1991. Requires the Administrator to evaluate such results until no later than July 1, 1992. Authorizes appropriations for such evaluations for FY 1991 and 1992. Authorizes the Administrator to recommend changes in the requirements of the second stage based upon the first stage research evaluations. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on proposed changes by July 1, 1992, and requires such changes to increase protection of sensitive areas and mitigation of identified damage. Permits two or more States to reallot their shares among themselves so long as the total required reduction is achieved. Requires each State to adopt enforceable reduction measures for phase II requirements by a specified date, submitting them to the Administrator for approval and to other States for comment. Imposes civil penalties for violations of State requirements. Requires a major stationary source in a State without an approved reduction plan to comply with an established schedule. Requires the owner of such a facility to submit for the Administrator's approval an emissions reduction plan to meet such schedule. Permits the use of the following measures to reduce emissions in addition to enforceable continuous emission reduction measures if such measures are enforceable by entities and persons other than the State in which the emissions occur: (1) least emissions dispatch to meet electric generating demand at existing generating capacity; (2) retirement of major stationary sources at an earlier than provided for date; (3) investments in energy conservation where emission reductions can be identified with such investments; (4) precombustion cleaning of fuels; (5) fuel substitution; and (6) trading of emission reduction requirements and actual reductions through emission reduction banks or brokerage institutions. Requires specified primary nonferrous smelters to be in compliance with the applicable emission limitation or standard for sulfur oxides by January 2, 1988. Requires the Secretary of State to give special emphasis to ensuring that the Nacozari smelter in Mexico meets pollution control standards under the Clean Air Act when negotiating with Mexico an Annex concerning transboundary air pollution to the 1983 Border Environmental Agreement. Requires such Annex to address pollution control and monitoring at other smelters within the United States and Mexico. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator to report to the Congress within six months after enactment of this Act on the implementation of such negotiation. Requires the EPA to perform atmospheric field experiments to determine the effects of pollution controls on the Nacozari smelter. Directs the Secretary to utilize an international agency to study and report on transboundary air pollution from copper smelters in the United States and Mexico. Sets oxides of nitrogen emissions standards for motor vehicles for model years 1989 and after (1990 and after for passenger cars).</summary>
