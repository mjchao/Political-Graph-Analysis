  <summary>9/23/1988--Introduced.
Bootstrap Schools Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) to enhance the quality of education provided at elementary and secondary schools through establishing bootstrap school programs. Makes an LEA eligible for such a grant if it submits an application and serves a qualified area, i.e. any area of the State in which the percentage of the population whose annual gross income does not exceed the poverty line is twice the percentage of the State population. Sets forth requirements for contents of applications. Requires that special consideration be given to applications which describe a program to: (1) serve areas in which at least 60 percent of the population has an annual gross income that does not exceed the poverty line; and (2) improve academic standards and performance at schools through measures such as: (1) open enrollment; (2) school-based management of curricula, class size, and funds; (3) professionalization of teachers, as determined by the Secretary; (4) alternative certification of teachers; (5) reduction of the number of nonteaching personnel; and (6) merit pay for teachers. Requires each LEA recipient to use the grant only for: (1) planning and outreach activities directly related to expanding and enhancing academic programs and services offered at such schools; (2) acquisition of teaching materials, books, and equipment for educational programs (including computers); and (3) teacher compensation. Requires that such use be directly related to increasing the knowledge of students attending elementary and secondary schools, under the LEA's jurisdiction, in mathematics, science, history, English, foreign languages, art, or music or to improving their vocation skills. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 for such grants.</summary>
