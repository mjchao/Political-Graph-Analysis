  <summary>9/16/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to establish rule LI regarding security briefings for House employees. Requires a House employee who holds a security clearance to attend a security briefing: (1) at the time the security clearance is issued or at the time of employment; (2) at the time the security clearance is renewed or upgraded; and (3) at least once every six months from the last briefing. Provides that any House employee who is not in compliance with rule LI may be denied access to classified information in the possession of the House. Expresses the sense of the House that the agency which issued the security clearance should consider suspending such clearance for any House employee not in compliance with such rule.</summary>
