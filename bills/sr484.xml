  <summary>10/3/1988--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should oppose any restrictions on European Community imports of nongrain feed ingredients, including corn gluten feed, and should support the current duty-free binding on such products; (2) the President should oppose any European Community proposals which would violate the intent of the existing duty-free binding in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade for corn gluten feed and corn byproducts; and (3) if unilateral action is taken by the European Community to inhibit the importation of corn gluten, the United States should restrict imports from the Community of at least the aggregate value of the reduced U.S. export products.</summary>
