  <summary>3/12/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) an independent, professionally controlled, nonprofit National Board for Professional Teaching Standards should be established for teacher certification in elementary and secondary education; (2) the certification process and assessments associated with it should meet specified recommended standards; and (3) the States should decide whether to require certification for teaching licensure purposes. Encourages the States to: (1) recognize such certification process through teacher incentives; (2) consider the incorporation of Board standards in the teacher licensure process; and (3) broaden the scope of the certification process to include other education professionals.</summary>
