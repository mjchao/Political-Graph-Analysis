Title II: Administrative Provisions - Provides, with regard to the comprehensive homeless assistance plan required under such Act, for: (1) plan sharing among a State and its cities and urban counties; (2) annual plan submissions; (3) inclusion of recipient assurances to maintain drug and alcohol abuse-free facilities; and (4) coordination of homeless assistance efforts. Makes religious organizations, or organizations with religious affiliations meeting specified conditions, eligible to receive housing assistance under title IV of such Act and community development block grants under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Title III: Emergency Shelter Grants - Makes the environmental policy and historic preservation provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 applicable to the emergency shelter grants program.

Title IV: Supportive Housing - Includes public housing agencies within the definition of "project sponsor" for purposes of the supportive housing demonstration program. Includes within the definition of "permanent housing" for purposes of such program projects in excess of the eight-person limitation in situations where local market conditions favor such projects and their development will achieve neighborhood integration objectives.

Prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from requiring project applications to demonstrate that the applicant owns or controls the proposed project's site. Requires recipient matching funds to come from non-Federal sources. Defines "non-Federal sources" to include State or local agency funds, the non-Federal share of funds from other Federal programs, and the value of donated material or buildings and the value of any building lease.

Authorizes recipients to receive both advance and rehabilitation assistance. Permits reallocation of project assistance.

Defines "major spaces" for fire and safety improvement purposes as hallways, large common areas, and other areas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) determine whether an alternative system of distributing funds under title IV of such Act would be feasible if based on homeless population data; and (2) report to the Congress by March 1, 1989. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study of the effect of rent controls on housing stocks, including low-income housing; and (2) report to the Congress within six months of enactment of this Act. Title VI: Technical Amendments - Directs the Secretary to process the Tweemill House, New York, housing loan application without regard to certain cost and rent limits. Amends the Housing Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish guidelines for the selection of qualified rural housing purchasers in situations of more than one purchase offer.
