  <summary>6/29/1987--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to a school district in Payson, Arizona, specified lands known as the Payson School Site in Gila County, Arizona, for use as a public school. Requires the conveyance to take place, upon request of the school district, within 30 years for fair market value and administrative costs, reduced by amounts already paid by the school district for use of such property. Permits the school district to continue to use and occupy the property for an annual fee before the conveyance is completed. Retains a right of reversion to the United States if the school district attempts to transfer title or use the property for other than a public school.</summary>
