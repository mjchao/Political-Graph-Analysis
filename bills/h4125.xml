Children's Television Act of 1988 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to exempt from Federal antitrust laws any joint discussion, consideration, review, action, or agreement (unless a boycott results) by or among television networks, television trade associations, and other persons in the television industry for the limited purpose of developing and disseminating voluntary guidelines designed to promote the educational and informational impact of children's television broadcasting and to avoid abusive advertising during such programs. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to consider, in the context of television broadcast license renewals, compliance with any voluntary guidelines resulting from such discussions.</summary>
