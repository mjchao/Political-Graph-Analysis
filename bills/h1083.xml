  <summary>2/11/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended by the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1987, to prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture from denying a person status as a separate person for purposes of agricultural program assistance payment limitations on the ground that a family member, landlord, or tenant cosigned for, or loaned or leased equipment, land, or labor to, such person. Requires the Secretary to make payments to persons denied program assistance on such grounds. Directs and authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations requiring that a determination of any farm program application provision must be made within 45 days of approval by a county committee (with exceptions for redeterminations involving fraud or substantial noncompliance).</summary>
