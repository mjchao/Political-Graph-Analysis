  <summary>6/18/1987--Introduced.
National Training Incentives Act of 1987 - Declares that it is the policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to encourage cooperation between employers and employees to promote training programs which will assist employees, should they be displaced from the work force, in training for a trade or occupation for which present and future employment opportunities exist. Title I: Amendments to Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Relating to Employee Training - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish an employee training credit for employers. Adds such employee training credit to those credits which are included in the current year business credit for purposes of determining the general business income tax credit for a taxable year. Makes such employee training credit for any taxable year equal to 25 percent of the excess, if any, of: (1) the qualified training expenses of the taxpayer for such taxable year, over (2) the base period training expenses of such taxpayer. Defines "qualified training expenses" as the aggregate amount of expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with the training of employees under approved training programs. Defines "base period training expenses" as the average of the qualified training expenses for each year in the base period. Defines "base period" as the five taxable years of the taxpayer immediately preceding the taxable year for which the determination is being made ("the determination year"). Sets forth transitional rules for the first four determination years beginning after December 31, 1984. Sets minimum base period training expenses by providing that, in the case of any determination year of the taxpayer for which the qualified training expenses exceed 200 percent of the base period training expenses, "50 percent of such qualified training expenses" shall be substituted for "the base period training expenses" in the formula to determine the amount of the credit. Defines "approved training program," for purposes of such employee training credit, to include: (1) any apprenticeship program registered or approved by Federal or State agencies; (2) any employer-designed or employer-sponsored training program which meets certain requirements prescribed by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary); (3) any cooperative education; (4) any training program designated by the Secretary which is carried out under the supervision of an institution of higher education; or (5) any other training program approved by the Secretary. Sets forth the special tax rules for the aggregation of qualified training expenses, allocations of such credits, and adjusted to such employee training credit amount for acquisitions and dispositions of a trade or business. Specifies that the employee training credit shall be in addition to any other deduction or credit allowed for the same expenses under the Federal tax law. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt from any penalty tax early withdrawal from an individual retirement plan of a displaced worker if such withdrawals are made to pay training expenses, do not exceed the allowable amount, and are made in accordance with the requirements of this Act. Title II: Withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts and Annuities for Job Training for Displaced Workers - Entitles a displaced worker to apply to the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) for certification of such individual's status as a displaced worker. Defines a "displaced worker" as any individual, as of the time of application for a certificate, who has at least 20 quarters of coverage under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, who has received employment counseling within the past year from an agency approved by the Secretary, and who is in one of the following categories: (1) receiving regular State unemployment compensation; (2) exhausted the right to receive such compensation; (3) unemployed, or received notification of termination of employment within six months, due to permanent closure of a plant or facility; or (4) unemployed for six months or more and with limited opportunity for employment in a similar trade or occupation within a reasonable commuting distance. Permits displaced workers to withdraw amounts from their individual retirement account or annuity (IRA) to pay the expense (tuition, fees, books, supplies, or required equipment) of an eligible training program. Limits the amounts of such IRA withdrawal to $5,000 per year (with cost-of-living adjustments), minus aggregate amounts distributed for training expense payments in the four immediately preceding taxable years. Requires withdrawals from an IRA for training expenses to be made only through the use of a voucher issued by the account trustee or insurance company custodian upon presentation to such trustee or custodian by the displaced worker of a displaced worker certificate and an invoice or statement evidencing that such worker has enrolled in an eligible training program. Sets forth requirements for the presentation and redemption of vouchers for payment of job training expenses. Prohibits depository institutions from assessing any penalty against a displaced worker for early withdrawals from an IRA to pay such training expenses. Permits adjustments in the rate of return on certain investments when IRA funds are withdrawn to pay such training expenses. Treats participation by a displaced worker in an eligible training program at a qualified institution as being in training with the approval of the State agency for purposes of State unemployment compensation law. Defines "eligible training program" as a training program offered by an institution of higher education, a postsecondary vocational institution, a proprietary institution of higher education, or any other institution approved by the Secretary which prepares students for gainful employment in a trade or occupation in which present and future employment opportunities exist. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations for: (1) the application of an educational institution for qualification of its training program; and (2) criteria for determining whether such a job training program qualified as an eligible training program under the terms of this Act. Directs the Secretary, for purposes of determining whether certain job training programs qualify as eligible training programs, to consider any determination relating to such programs made by: (1) the Administrator of Veterans Affairs or a State approving agency for veterans' educational programs; (2) a private industry council established under the Job Training Partnership Act or other official or group empowered to make determinations under such Act; (3) the Secretary of Education; (4) any State education agency; or (5) a nationally recognized accrediting agency which the Secretary determines to be reliable in evaluating the quality of job training programs. Sets forth nondiscrimination requirements for institutions offering such job training programs. Requires the Secretary to minimize the amount of paperwork and time necessary to certify any individual as a displaced worker or any training program as an eligible training program. Title III: State Employment Service Responsibilities - Directs the Secretary of Labor to allocate funds to States to reimburse administrative costs of public employment offices which provide certification for displaced workers, labor market and training information, and job search services. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose for FY 1988 and thereafter. Directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress on a nationwide computerized job bank and matching program authorized under the Job Training and Partnership Act. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act to direct the private industry councils established under such Act to make information on job training programs available throughout their service delivery areas. Exempts such councils from limitations on expenditures imposed by such Act in providing such information. Excludes from the computation of the amount of the expected family contribution to a student for Pell Grant purposes any unemployment compensation received by such student or any IRA distribution used to pay training expenses of such student, provided such student is certified as a displaced worker under the terms of this Act.</summary>
