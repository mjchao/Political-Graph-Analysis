  <summary>7/17/1987--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment, S. Rept. 100-115) Amends the Clayton Act to revise premerger notification and waiting period requirements. Applies such requirements to proposed mergers where the total assets or annual net sales of the smaller of the acquiring party or the target party equal or exceed $15,000,000 (currently, $10,000,000) and the aggregate amount of voting securities and assets of the target party that the acquiring party would hold exceeds $20,000,000 (currently, $15,000,000). Increases to 20 days (currently, 15 days) the waiting period following notification of a proposed merger in the case of a cash tender offer. Eliminates the ten-day extension on such waiting period (and thus permits a 20-day extension) with respect to proposed mergers involving cash tender offers. Permits the U.S. district court to extend such waiting period up to an additional 25 days if, due to the complexity or scope of the information to be evaluated, the Federal Trade Commission or the Assistant Attorney General requires such additional time to determine whether the proposed merger may violate the antitrust laws.</summary>
