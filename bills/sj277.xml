Declares that the President should: (1) continue and expedite existing bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union regarding scientific, legal, and enforcement concerns about fishing activities within the area of international waters in the Bering Sea (known as the donut hole) and regarding development and implementation of conservation goals consistent with international law; (2) seek the consent of all nations whose fishing fleets operate in the Bering Sea regarding management and conservation in the region; (3) exercise existing authority under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and ask that all nations that have Governing International Fishery Agreements with the United States use position-fixing identification equipment on all fishing boats in U.S. waters or within the donut region; and (4) report to the Congress within 90 days of passage of this resolution on progress toward achieving the objectives of this resolution.</summary>
