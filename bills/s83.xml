  <summary>2/17/1987--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #28 (89-6)) National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to add to the list of products covered under the Act: (1) freezers which can be operated by alternating current electricity (with specified exceptions); (2) central air conditioning heat pumps; (3) direct heating equipment; and (4) pool heaters. Deletes from specific coverage: (1) humidifiers; and (2) dehumidifiers. Excludes from such coverage consumer products designed solely for use in recreational vehicles and other mobile equipment. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to amend Federal energy efficiency test procedures for appliances under specified guidelines. Prohibits manufacturers from making any representations regarding the energy efficiency of appliances covered by this Act unless such appliances have been tested in accordance with the Federal test procedures, and the manufacturer's representations fairly disclose the results of such testing. Sets forth specific Federal energy conservation standards for products covered by this Act and manufactured after certain dates. Establishes deadlines by which the Secretary must issue rules regarding such standards. Details the criteria to be applied if such standards are revised. Provides that after the statutory deadlines have been met, the Secretary is authorized to publish further final rules to determine whether standards for a covered product should be amended. Authorizes any person to petition the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking to determine whether the standards established in previous rulemakings should be amended. Sets forth the criteria which the Secretary must meet in order to grant such a petition. Revises the information requirements with which manufacturers must comply to provide that the Secretary shall exercise authority in a manner designed to minimize unnecessary burdens on manufacturers of covered products. Revises the rules under which State regulations are superseded by the Federal regulations for testing and labeling requirements and energy conservation standards. Permits the waiver of Federal preemption if the Secretary finds that such waiver is needed to meet compelling and unusual local energy conditions. Prescribes procedural guidelines for such a waiver. Details conditions under which State and local building code requirements regarding energy conservation standards are not superseded by the standards promulgated under this Act. Permits the commencement of a citizen's suit against the Secretary for failure to comply with a nondiscretionary duty to issue rules according to prescribed schedules. Directs the courts to expedite the disposition of such suits. Vests jurisdiction in the Federal district courts over actions brought by: (1) any adversely affected person to determine whether a State or local government is complying with the requirements of this Act; and (2) any person who files a petition for an amended standard which has been denied by the Secretary. Declares that the required submission by the Secretary of an annual report regarding Federal energy efficiency standards does not constitute a defense or justification for a failure by the Secretary to comply with the nondiscretionary duty provided for in this Act.</summary>
