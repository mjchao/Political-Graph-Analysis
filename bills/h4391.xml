  <summary>4/14/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Controlled Substances Act to establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the manufacture, distribution, importation, and exportation of Phenyl acetone, Phenyl-2-propanone, Methylamine, and Ether (chemicals utilized in the manufacture of methamphetamine). Prohibits the distribution or exportation of such chemicals unless the recipient provides a certification of lawful use and proper identification. Establishes exemptions from such requirements: (1) for the distribution of such chemicals between agents or employees within a single facility; (2) for the delivery of such chemicals to or by common carriers; and (3) where the drug products containing such chemicals are lawfully marketed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Establishes, with respect to such chemicals: (1) an import-export permit requirement; and (2) a declaration requirement. States that any person convicted of certain Controlled Substances Act violations relating to the receipt of such chemicals shall be enjoined from conducting business activities with such chemicals for a minimum of ten years.</summary>
