  <summary>6/2/1987--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended, roll call #158 (295-93)) Amends the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 to prohibit the issuance of patents for oil shale claims after February 5, 1987. Exempts from such prohibition those claims for which patent application had been filed and all patent requirements had been fully complied with by such date. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake an expedited program to determine, within two years after enactment of this Act, the validity of all unpatented oil shale claims, and to promptly cancel any claim determined to be invalid. Requires the owner of each unpatented oil shale claim to elect, within 90 days after enactment of this Act, to either: (1) apply to the Secretary for a lease; or (2) maintain the claim by complying with all laws pertaining to the maintenance of mining claims, including regulations regarding annual expenditures which represent diligent efforts towards shale oil production and substantial work on the claims. Requires the Secretary to cancel the claim of any owner who does not make such an election. Requires the Secretary to: (1) promulgate a final rule within 90 days after enactment of this Act regarding such annual expenditure requirement; (2) review such expenditures on an annual basis; and (3) cancel any claim for which the annual expenditure requirement has not been met. Mandates that lease or claim holders under this Act must reclaim the affected site and post a bond before disturbance of the site to guarantee such reclamation.</summary>
