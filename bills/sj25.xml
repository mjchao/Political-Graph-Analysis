Constitutional Amendment - Requires, before each fiscal year: (1) the President to submit to the Congress a proposed statement of revenues and appropriations for the upcoming fiscal year and measures necessary to assure that appropriations will not exceed revenues; and (2) the Congress to approve such a statement and adopt measures to assure that appropriations do not exceed revenues for that year. Prohibits any bill which causes appropriations to exceed revenues for a fiscal year from becoming law unless passed by two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Authorizes the Congress to waive this Article in a national emergency.</summary>
