  <summary>5/10/1988--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States Trade Representative (USTR) should continue to pursue the U.S. complaint against Japan's obstructive citrus and beef import practices with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Council seeking a decision that Japan is in violation of the GATT; (2) the USTR is urged to initiate an investigation of the enforcement of U.S. trade rights or unfair trade practices in response to the petition filed by the Florida Citrus Mutual and others; (3) the USTR should pursue such investigation of alleged unfair trade practices; (4) the President should use his authority under the Trade Act of 1974 to restore trade benefits due the U.S. citrus industry which arise from Japan's imposition of quantitative restrictions on U.S. oranges and orange juice; and (5) the President should take action to obtain the recommendation of the GATT Contracting Parties that Japan eliminate or bring into conformity with GATT its citrus and beef import practices with respect to U.S. imports.</summary>
