  <summary>3/23/1987--Introduced.
Bilingual Education Improvement Act of 1987 - Amends the Bilingual Education Act (title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) to extend the Federal bilingual education program through FY 1993. Requires programs receiving assistance under this Act to be designed to enable students to meet grade-promotion and graduation requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993. Increases from $50,000 to $75,000 the minimum State education grant under this Act. Allows grantees to engage in preservice activities for up to one year (the current limit is six months). Requires parental notification of program instructional goals to be in a language and form that parents understand. Requires the Department of Education to consult with State Directors of bilingual education in matters pertaining to the administration of Federal bilingual education programs. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary of Education to study the content of textbooks. Declares that a minimum of 500 fellowships shall be made available each year (for FY 1988 through 1993) for the advanced study of bilingual education. Requires the Director of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs to submit annual reports to the President and to the Congress on the grants and contracts made pursuant to this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit biennial reports (beginning in 1988) to the Congress on the condition of bilingual education and the administration and operation of this Act. Prohibits the Secretary from imposing restrictions on the availability or use of funds authorized under this Act.</summary>
