Title VI: Policies for the Multilateral Development Banks - Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to direct the Secretaries of the Treasury and State, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID), to vigorously promote mechanisms to strengthen the environmental performance of multilateral development banks. Declares that the mechanisms shall include, but are not limited to, strengthening organizational, administrative, and procedural arrangements within the banks. Directs the Administrator, in the course of reviewing assistance proposals of the multilateral development banks, to ensure that other agencies and appropriate U.S. embassies and overseas missions of AID are instructed to analyze the environmental impacts of multilateral development loans in advance of such loans' approval to determine whether the proposals will contribute to the sustainable development of the borrowing country. Provides that if there is reason to believe that any such loan may have adverse impacts on the environment, then the Administrator shall ensure that the mission or embassy undertakes an affirmative investigation of such impacts in consultation with relevant Federal agencies. Requires any information collected to be made available to the public. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the Executive Directors representing the United States at the Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank to urge to management and other directors of each such bank, to provide sufficient time between the circulation of assistance proposals and bank action on those proposals, in order to permit their evaluation by major shareholder governments. Requires the Administrator to identify those assistance proposals likely to have adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, or indigenous peoples and to transmit such information to specified congressional committees. Requires the Secretary to forward such information to the Executive Director representing the United States in the appropriate bank with instructions to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts which may result from the proposal. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Administrator, to create a system for cooperative exchange of information with other interested member countries on assistance proposals of the multilateral development banks. Directs the Secretary to instruct the United States Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks to support the strengthening of educational programs within each such bank to improve the capacity of a mid-level manager to initiate and manage environmental aspects of development activities, and to train officials of borrowing countries in the conduct of environmental analyses. Directs the Secretary to instruct U.S. Executive Directors in the multilateral development banks to: (1) urge each institution to identify and develop procedures to give appropriate consideration to environmental values in decision making; and (2) include within each assistance proposal circulated to the Board of Directors a detailed environmental statement analyzing the environmental impact of the imposed action, the adverse environmental impacts should the proposal be implemented, and alternatives to the proposed action. Directs the Secretary to instruct U.S. Executive Directors of each multilateral development bank to promote: (1) increases in the proportion of loans supporting environmentally beneficial policies, projects, and project components; (2) the establishment of environmental programs in policy-based lending to improve natural resource management, environmental quality, and protection of biological diversity; (3) increases in the proportion of staff with professional training and experience in ecology and related areas and in the areas of anthropological and sociological impact analysis; (4) encouragement of participation by borrowing countries nongovernmental environmental, community, and indigenous peoples' organizations at all stages of project preparation and implementation; and (5) full availability to concerned or affected nongovernmental and community organizations of full documentary information concerning details of design and potential environmental and sociocultural impacts of proposed loans. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report on the progress being made to implement environmental objectives to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary, after consultations with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior on markets and prices for commodities, to periodically instruct the U.S. Executive Directors to work with other executive directors to continue to: (1) support activities which result in broad increases in income and employment and enhance purchasing power in developing countries, particularly among the rural poor; and (2) encourage diversification away from single crop or product economies in developing countries to help reduce wide fluctuations on commodity prices and the adverse impact of abrupt changes in the terms of trade. Requires the Secretary to discourage multilateral development banks from financing projects which will result in the production of surplus commodities, products, or minerals for export. Directs the Secretary, in negotiations concerning replenishment or an increase in capital for any multilateral development bank, to propose the following institutional reforms: (1) the establishment of a unified program within each multilateral development bank to assess the extent to which bank lending benefits the least advantaged members of society, particularly women and the poor, and to increase the extent to which such members benefit from future bank lending; (2) the establishment of procedures within each multilateral development bank to provide in-country liaison services for nongovernmental organizations operating at the community level, to monitor the impact of project and non-project lending on local populations, and to ensure compliance with loan conditionalities; (3) a major increase in professional staff with training in environmental or social impact analysis or natural science; (4) with respect to the Bank, the establishment of a program for policy-based lending to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources and the protection of the environment in borrowing countries; and (5) an increase in the length of any review period for board review of staff recommendations sufficient to allow the governments of member countries to review and comment on such recommendations before the board takes action. Directs the Secretary to instruct each U.S. Executive Director to require the management of each multilateral development bank to prepare an annual report which identifies and describes the most exemplary lending practices or loan components implemented during the preceding year with respect to specified lending policy goals for each major borrowing country or country group. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank and the International Development Association (IDA) to initiate discussions with other directors of the respective institutions and to propose that: (1) guidelines be established which reflect concern for the impact that adjustment lending programs, and the activities such programs support, have and will have on human welfare; and (2) impact statements be required which assess the effect an adjustment lending program, and the activities such program supports, will have on the poor of the country to which such lending is made. Requires such impact statements to specify the effects of each adjustment loan on the poor, explain the procedures which the borrowing country has taken or will take to measure those effects (including the monitoring of nutrition levels), and indicate the steps the borrowing country will take to mitigate adverse effects on the poor and to maximize the benefits to them. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank and the IDA to request the management of the respective institutions to prepare a report on such topics. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank and the IDA to propose the establishment of a Grassroots Collaboration Program to develop improved mechanisms for involving nongovernmental organizations in the design, implementation, and monitoring of development projects to alleviate poverty and promote environmental protection. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Grassroots Collaboration Program should be implemented and financed as part of the normal operations of the Bank and the IDA. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such program could be financed through a grant from the net income of the Bank. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the status of the establishment of such program. Requires each annual report to the Congress by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to describe the status of the establishment and operation of the program. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank and the IDA to initiate discussions with other directors and to propose that: (1) the Bank or IDA take such steps as necessary to increase access for the poor people of a borrowing country to formal sources of credit; and (2) the Bank of IDA include a requirement in all appropriate agreements that the borrowing country identify and remove unreasonable legal and regulatory barriers to the establishment or operation of organizations which extend credit, and to the provision of credit to microenterprises for small scale economic activities. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank to initiate discussions with other directors to propose that each such bank: (1) examine the Program for the Financing of Small Projects of the Inter-American Development Bank and the steps taken to link the Program to the mainstream operation of the bank; and (2) explore ways and means to establish similar programs to provide credit to microenterprises for small scale economic activities. Requires each annual report to the Congress by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to describes the status of microenterprise credit promotion activities of the Bank, IDA, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. Declares the policy of the United States that multilateral development banks should fully involve women in development activities and projects. Directs the Secretary to instruct: (1) the U.S. Executive Director of the Bank and IDA to support attempts to strengthen the role of women in Development division in policy development, project design and implementation, and evaluation; and (2) the U.S. Executive Directors of the regional multilateral development banks to support exploring the establishment of a mechanism, or the strengthening of an existing mechanism, to promote the full integration of women in the planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of lending activities in borrowing countries and within the banks. Requires each annual report to the Congress by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to describe the actions taken by the multilateral development banks to implement policies established by this Act. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to propose that the banks: (1) take appropriate steps to measure the impacts of projects on indigenous peoples in borrowing countries; (2) ensure compliance with loan conditions protecting the rights of such people to lands and resources; and (3) consult with such peoples and nongovernmental organizations representing them at every phase of loan design, planning, and implementation, and monitoring.</summary>
