  <summary>2/24/1988--Introduced.
Repeals provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 relating to the taxation of both individual and corporate capital gains. Provides that the Internal Revenue Code shall be applied and administered as if such provisions had not been enacted. (The capital gains tax rate for corporations would generally be 28 percent.) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the method of calculating the deduction for capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers. Allows a capital gains deduction equal to: (1) 80 percent for assets held ten years or longer; and (2) 40 percent for assets held for between three and ten years. Amends the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to revise the holding period required for long-term capital gain tax treatment of property.</summary>
