Amends the definition of "household" to repeal the provision providing separate household status for certain parents of minor children and for such children. Makes permanent categorical program eligibility based on eligibility for specified social security programs. Provides an additional excess shelter deduction. States that: (1) households not required to submit monthly income reports shall have their income calculated on a prospective basis; and (2) households required to submit monthly income reports shall have their income calculated on a retrospective basis, except under specified circumstances. Repeals the requirement of prior approval by the Secretary of Agriculture for less than monthly income reporting of certain households. Prohibits a state agency from requiring periodic reporting of households: (1) made up entirely of migrant or seasonal farm workers; (2) made up entirely of homeless persons; or (3) with no earned income and in which all adult members are elderly or disabled.

McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, to extend the temporary emergency food assistance program (TEFAP) through FY 1990. Increases the amount of TEFAP funds for emergency feeding organizations. Amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to authorize appropriations through FY 1993 for the community food and nutrition program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study (through the National Academy of Sciences) of the kinds of medical problems commonly suffered by program participants and the resulting special diets; and (2) report to the Congress. Title II: Child Nutrition Promotion - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to exclude foster care and adoption assistance from program income determinations.
