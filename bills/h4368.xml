  <summary>4/13/1988--Introduced.
Amends Federal law relating to Federal participation in State toll road pilot programs to require that, in the case of Texas, the State highway department and the Texas Turnpike Authority must enter into a toll revenues agreement with the Secretary of Transportation as a prerequisite to Federal permission for such participation. States that upon request of the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation, the Secretary must allocate to the Texas Turnpike Authority the amounts that would be payable to the Department as the Federal share of project costs if the Department were implementing a project. Mandates such allocations from sums apportioned to Texas for Federal-aid primary system projects.</summary>
