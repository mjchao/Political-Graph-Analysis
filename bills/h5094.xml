Requires the disapproval of the Federal Reserve Board if an applicant submits an incomplete application, or if the Board determines that certain community benefit, public benefit, or minimum risk-based capital requirements have not been met.

Requires the Federal Reserve Board to conduct a study and report to the Congress on whether the use of the same term, such as an annual percentage rate, to describe the cost to the consumer for extensions of credit under all forms of consumer credit plans may unduly mislead consumers with respect to the comparability of the various forms of such extension of credit.

Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to make committee members, employees, or agents of an insured credit union subject to administrative enforcement orders. (Current law provides that only officers and directors of depository institutions are subject to such enforcement orders.) Revises the authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to issue cease and desist orders concerning depository institutions within their respective jurisdictions.

Deletes the requirement that the regulatory agency must show misconduct by an officer or director which results in "substantial" financial loss or other damage to the depository institution. (Allows the temporary removal of an officer or director for misconduct pending a permanent removal if necessary for the protection of the institution or depositors). Provides for identical standards for such removal regardless of where the misconduct occurred. (Current law provides for different standards depending on whether the misconduct took place at another institution or business enterprise or at the particular institution from which removal is sought.) Allows the regulatory agency involved to seek such a suspension or removal in cases where an officer or director has violated any written agreement between the institution and the regulatory agency. Prohibits any person who has been removed or suspended from office or prohibited from participating in the affairs of a depository institution by an order of the FDIC, the FHLBB, the FSLIC, or the NCUA from holding any office in, or participating in the affairs of, any federally regulated depository institution or holding company or subsidiary.

Allows an exception to such prohibition upon written approval of the appropriate regulatory agency. Provides for the judicial review of denial of such an exception. Authorizes the FDIC, the FHLBB, the FSLIC, and the NCUA to provide notice of the intention to prohibit any person from participating in the affairs of any federally regulated depository institution, notwithstanding the fact that such person has ceased to hold the position of officer or director or has ceased to participate in the conduct of the affairs of such a depository institution before such notice is served. Increases from $1,000 per day to $2,500 per day the civil penalty for the violation of a cease and desist order or an order for the suspension or removal of an officer or director issued by a Federal banking regulatory agency. Imposes a $2,500 civil penalty (in addition to penalties for violations of such orders) for a violation of: (1) any law or regulation; (2) any written condition imposed by the appropriate Federal banking agency in connection with the grant of any application or other request; or (3) any written agreement between the depository institution and the appropriate Federal banking agency. Imposes criminal penalties upon any person who participates in the affairs of any federally regulated depository institution or holding company or subsidiary after having been suspended, removed from office, or prohibited from participating in the affairs of any depository institution by an order of the appropriate Federal banking regulatory agency. (Current law imposes criminal penalties only for participating in the affairs of the institution from which the person was prohibited, removed, or suspended.) Revises procedures for the termination of FDIC deposit insurance to delete provisions requiring 120 days' advance notice by the FDIC to the appropriate Federal and State banking regulatory agencies prior to such a termination. Increases from $100 per day to $2,500 per day the penalty for unauthorized participation in the affairs of a depository institution by any person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or a breach of trust. Makes both the depository institution and the individual involved subject to such penalty. (Current law makes only the depository institution subject to such penalty.) Authorizes the FHLBB and the FSLIC to issue civil enforcement orders concerning a service corporation of an association or a subsidiary of such service corporation, whether wholly or partly owned. (Current law limits such authority to orders concerning an affiliate service corporation of an association.) Amends the Bank Protection Act of 1968 to repeal requirements for depository institutions to submit periodic reports with regard to the installation, maintenance, and operation of security devices and procedures. Imposes civil penalties for the filing of false or misleading reports of condition by depository institutions and holding companies. (Current law allows penalties only for late reports.)

Subtitle B: Report to Congress - Requires the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the FHLBB, the FSLIC, and the NCUA to submit annual reports to the Congress concerning: (1) the number of formal and informal supervisory, administrative, and civil enforcement actions undertaken by the agency; (2) the number of individuals and institutions against whom civil money penalties were assessed; (3) a description of all other enforcement efforts and initiatives relating to unsafe and unsound practices; and (4) recommendations concerning the need for additional legislation or financial resources. Title VII: Federal Asset Disposition Association - Federal Asset Disposition Association Dissolution Act - Amends the National Housing Act to specify that the purpose for establishing new savings and loan associations in connection with liquidations is for such an association to operate as an issuer of savings accounts and a lender and investor and not as an institution having the special purpose of managing or disposing of assets acquired from insured institutions in default. Specifies that provisions of the National Housing Act shall not be construed as authorizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to organize a new Federal association for the purpose of managing or disposing of any assets: (1) of an insured institution for which the FSLIC has been appointed receiver; or (2) acquired by the FSLIC in order to prevent a default. Authorizes the FSLIC to delegate such liquidation functions to an appropriate regional office. Prohibits the Federal Asset Disposition Association (FADA) from engaging in any new activities after the date of the enactment of this Act. Directs the FSLIC to require FADA to assign all its rights and obligations under any contract to the FSLIC. Requires the FSLIC, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to revoke the charter of FADA and assume its assets and liabilities.

Requires the FSLIC to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the FSLIC and all officers and employees of the FSLIC maintain full compliance with the competitive procurement requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Requires the FSLIC to liquidate the assets of insolvent savings and loan associations in a manner which: (1) minimizes the cost to the FSLIC; (2) maximizes the return which the FSLIC realizes on the assets; and (3) encourages the use of services of persons in the private sector in managing and disposing of such assets to the maximum extent possible. Requires the FSLIC to ensure that no individuals are employed by the FSLIC under personal service contracts except to the extent that such employment: (1) does not exceed 60 days in any one-year period; or (2) is determined to be necessary because of unusual circumstances which do not allow the position involved to be filled by a civil service employee. Provides that the number of asset liquidation personnel employed by the FSLIC shall not be subject to any limitation imposed by any officer of the executive branch who is not an officer of the FSLIC. Imposes a statutory limit on the number of asset liquidation employees that may be employed at any time by the FSLIC. Requires the FSLIC to establish an employment grade structure for asset liquidation employees which is comparable to the grade structure for employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who manage or dispose of assets. Requires representatives of specified Government agencies and the private sector to conduct a multiagency study on options for reducing the duplication, overlap, and inconsistency among Federal agencies and instrumentalities and for making better use of private sector resources in managing and disposing of assets.
