  <summary>3/12/1987--Introduced.
Competition Savings Act of 1987 - Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require the Federal Government to contract with the private sector for the performance of a commercial activity when the cost is lower than the cost of the performance of such activity by the Government. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe regulations for such cost comparisons. Requires the Director to publish a commercial activity inventory each fiscal year in the Federal Register. Provides that such inventory shall consist of a list of all commercial activities carried out by full-time Government employees, and the cost of such activities. Requires each executive agency to complete cost comparisons or award contracts for commercial activities which constitute 20 percent of the number of activities listed in the agency's inventory for each fiscal year, beginning with FY 1989. Specifies commercial activities which are exempt from cost comparisons and those eligible for expedited procedures. Sets forth performance deadlines after completion of cost comparisons. Requires the inclusion of cost comparison results in budget requests. Provides for judicial review of decisions resulting from cost comparisons. Makes greater reliance on private sector sources a part of Federal procurement policy.</summary>
