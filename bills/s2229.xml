(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with amendment, S. Rept. 100-552) Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988 - Title I: Student Assistance - Amends title VII (Health Research and Teaching Facilities and Training of Professional Health Personnel) to exclude from the definition of "allied health professionals" individuals who have received a degree in social work or an equivalent degree. Sets ceilings on the total principal amount of new loans made and installments paid pursuant to lines of credit to borrowers covered by Federal loan insurance under specified provisions relating to loans to graduate students in health professions schools for FY 1989 through 1991. States that no insurance may be granted for any loan made or installment paid after September 30, 1994. Requires that the total principal amount of Federal loan insurance available in each fiscal year be granted without regard to any apportionment or other similar limitation. Requires interest on federally insured student loans under title VII to be compounded not more frequently than semiannually. (Current law requires the interest to be compounded semiannually.) Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to sell without recourse notes or other evidence of loans received by the United States through assignment by the insured after default. Prohibits a State statute of limitations from barring an action by an insured against a borrower if the action is commenced within six years of default. Revises provisions defining "school of allied health" as used in subpart I (Federal Program of Insured Loans to Graduate Students in Health Professions Schools) of part C of title VII to include programs that lead to baccalaureate as well as programs that lead to higher degrees. Adds references to schools of, and specified-level degrees in, chiropractic, allied health, and clinical psychology to provisions relating to the terms, conditions, and requirements concerning agreements between the Secretary and health professions schools, and between such schools and their students, regarding a student loan fund. Prohibits a State statute of limitations from barring an action by a school against a borrower if the action is commenced within six years of the date of default. Authorizes appropriations for making Federal capital contributions into the student loan funds of schools which have established the funds under specified provisions. Requires not less than 30 percent of the amounts appropriated in each fiscal year to be allocated to schools of allied health. Makes all schools which established such funds eligible for reallotment of funds from a student loan fund returned to the Secretary in any fiscal year. (Current law makes schools which established funds during a specified period eligible for reallotment.) Delays the period during which a capital distribution of the balance of the loan fund established by each school is required, changing it from between September 30, 1991, and December 31, 1991, to between September 30, 1994, and December 31, 1994. Amends part C (Student Assistance) of title VII to create a new subpart on traineeships. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to accredited schools of public health to provide traineeships in biostatistics, epidemiology, health administration, health planning, health policy analysis, environmental or occupational health, dietetics and nutrition, preventive medicine or dentistry, or maternal and child health. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Adds chiropractic schools to the list of schools to which the Secretary must make grants for health professions scholarships for students in exceptional financial need. Removes a requirement that students be in their first year of study in order to be eligible for such scholarships. Sets forth the elements of which the scholarships may consist. (Current law sets forth the same consistency as required rather than allowed.) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Title II: Grants to Improve the Quality of Schools of Public Health - Amends part E (Grants to Improve the Quality of Schools of Public Health) of title VII of the Public Health Service Act to require capitation grants to be made for schools of public health for FY 1989 through 1991.

Revises project eligibility criteria. Directs the Secretary to waive a requirement that a center be neither a school of medicine or osteopathy nor a subunit, parent, or member of a consortium of such entities if, at the time of the initial application for the contract, the center had an operating program supported by both appropriations of a State legislature and local resources. Revises program requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires the Secretary, in making grants and entering into contracts for projects concerning residency training programs in internal medicine or pediatrics, to give priority to applicants that demonstrate a commitment to coordination of curriculum development and resident teaching activities with departments of family medicine where there is a department within the same school.

Revises the list of permissible uses for grants and contracts made under existing provisions to assist individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to undertake education to enter a health profession, including allowing the paying of stipends to students enrolled in certain structured summer academic enrichment programs. Requires all individuals participating in activities supported by a grant to have completed to 10th grade of high school, or the equivalent.

Sets forth reporting requirements with regard to grants, contracts, and supplemental grants for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Replaces provisions relating to grants for two-year schools of medicine, interdisciplinary training, and curriculum development with provisions authorizing the Secretary to: (1) make grants to schools that provide the first or last two years of education leading to the degree of doctor of medicine or osteopathy; and (2) make grants and enter into contracts for the development and implementation of model projects in areas such as faculty and curriculum development, and development of new clinical training sites. Requires that priority in making grants and entering into contracts for the model projects be given to schools of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, public health, chiropractic, allied health, and to graduate programs in health administration and clinical psychology. Requires grant applications to be subject to peer review.
