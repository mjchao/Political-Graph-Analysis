Prohibits an increase in defense spending levels for FY 1988 through 1991 unless: (1) a reconciliation bill is enacted; or (2) the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means provide that changes in laws to increase revenues shall not take effect unless the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations report legislation appropriating the full amount of the defense spending levels for FY 1988.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that assumptions underlying the revenue levels provided for in this Act will not be achieved by either raising delaying the individual or corporate income tax rates provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the special needs of rural hospitals currently taken into account under the Medicare hospital prospective payment system should be taken into account in enacting legislation to reconcile Medicare Program expenditures with those required under the congressional concurrent resolution on the budget for FY 1988 and subsequent years.</summary>
