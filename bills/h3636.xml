  <summary>11/10/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 by providing for the determination of the national origin of a good based on the cost of manufacture of the article. Confers origin upon the last country of significant growth, processing, or manufacture where that good originates or provides inputs representing manufacturing costs of 35 percent or more of the value of the end product. Defines the end product, for purposes of imported goods, as the product entered into the United States, and the total value of the product against which that calculation is compared as the appraised, entered value as normally determined under such Act. Confers origin upon the last country satisfying the requirement, prior to the importation of the merchandise into the United States. Determines the national origin of goods subject to significant growth, processing, or manufacturing within the United States based upon comparable principles, and replaces the appraised, entered value with the total cost of manufacture of the end product. Makes this Act inapplicable for purposes of determining whether articles are eligible for duty-free treatment under: (1) the Trade Act of 1974; (2) the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act; or (3) the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act. Prohibits any cost of significant processing or manufacture permitted to be included in determining the origin of imported goods from being excluded for any purposes of determining the origin of end product which is subjected to significant processing or manufacture within, and offered for sale within, the United States. Provides that in the case of articles imported, and subjected to any process of manufacture within the United States, the total cost of manufacture within the United States shall be the total cost derived by combining costs of growth, processing, or manufacture prior to exportation from the United States consistent with the formula for setting duties under the Tariff Schedules, with those costs incurred in the United States after importation. Considers the United States to be the last country of manufacture where the total of such costs represents not less than 35 percent of the value of the end product offered for sale within the United States. Exempts articles imported into the United States to be used exclusively in the processing or manufacture of other articles, which will result in the United States becoming the country of origin, from requirements that they be labeled or marked as to country of origin upon importation, except as is necessary to inform the U.S. manufacturer utilizing such imports as input products. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury and other authorities to promulgate marking and labeling requirements necessary to ensure compliance with this Act. Directs the Secretary to ensure that articles imported for use in significant processing or manufacturing within the United States are not diverted to proscribed uses.</summary>
