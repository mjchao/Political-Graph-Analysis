  <summary>12/3/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should continue to pursue withdrawal initiatives aimed at removing Cuban troops from Angola and closing all South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) bases in southern Angola, and should withhold payment of the United States' proportionate share of the annual United Nations General Assembly budget until that organization and its affiliates terminate their designation of SWAPO as the "sole and authentic" representative of the Namibian people and adopt a policy of impartiality in the treatment of all Namibian political parties; (2) the Department of State should immediately establish contact with political party leaders of the Namibian Multi-Party Conference and the Namibia Transitional Government of National Unity; (3) the President should immediately make the determination necessary to terminate economic sanctions applicable to Namibia; and (4) the United States should take specified measures in support of Namibia's Transitional Government of National Unity pending internationally acceptable independence of Namibia.</summary>
