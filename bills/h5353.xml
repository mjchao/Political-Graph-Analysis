Family Preservation Act of 1988 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to eligible organizations to establish family preservation programs to provide assistance to families in order to prevent the placement of children under 18 years old in foster care. Sets forth eligibility requirements for applicant organizations. Requires all of the following assistance to be offered under such programs: (1) clothing, cleaning and housing locator services, family counseling services, services designed to improve communication skills; and (2) referrals to other organizations and State agencies. Directs the Secretary to: (1) give preference to applicants located in areas with the highest percentages of children in foster care; and (2) ensure that grants are made to eligible applicants in locations which reflect a diversity of geographical areas. Directs the Secretary to make such grants as follows: (1) ten grants in a specified amount to eligible applicants in ten different geographical areas for training and technical assistance in development of programs to provide families such goods and services in order to prevent placement of children in foster care; and (2) implementation grants to such ten grantees, in specified total and single maximum amounts. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with a selected organization for a study and report on the effectiveness of programs receiving such grants. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 for such grants and such study.</summary>
