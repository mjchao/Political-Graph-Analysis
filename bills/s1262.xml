  <summary>5/21/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to permit an insolvent taxpayer whose average annual gross income for at least half of the ten preceding years is attributable to farming to reduce the amount of the capital gains tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum tax in certain cases. Applies this revised definition of "farmer" to cases involving farm insolvency transactions made on and after January 1, 1982. (Prior law based the definition of "farmer" on income during the three preceding taxable years.)</summary>
