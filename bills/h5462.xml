  <summary>10/5/1988--Introduced.
United States-Mexico Border Region Housing and Community Development Act - Directs Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas to set aside specified percentages of community development block grant assistance to meet the needs of colonias relating to water, sewage, and housing. Limits assistance use to planning activities (including public information and technical assistance) and assessments for public improvements. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide rural housing assistance to colonias. Defines "colonia" for purposes of this Act as a community that: (1) is in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas; (2) is in the United States-Mexico border region; (3) is State or county-designated as a colonia on the basis of such criteria as inadequate housing, water, and sewage; and (4) was in existence and generally recognized as a colonia before the date of enactment of this Act. Limits the applicability of this Act to FY 1989 through 1991.</summary>
