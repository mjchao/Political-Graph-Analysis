Authorizes such funds based upon two alternative levels of new budget authority. Declares that the authorized amounts and personnel ceilings for such intelligence activities are those specified in the classified schedule of authorizations prepared by the conference committee to accompany this Act. Authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence to employ civilian personnel in excess of the ceiling for such personnel when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Restricts support for military and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. Title II: Intelligence Community Staff - Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Staff for FY 1988. Establishes an end strength ceiling of 237 full-time Intelligence Community Staff employees. Provides that such staff shall be administered in the same manner as the CIA. Title III: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1988. Title IV: Retirement and Death in Service Benefits - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees to provide that certain former spouses of CIA employees are entitled to retirement benefits and survivor annuities. Title V: Enhanced Counterintelligence and Security Capabilities - Requires the Attorney General to submit annual reports to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on the admission to the United States, over the objections of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of certain Soviet diplomatic personnel. Requires the Director of the FBI and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a study to ascertain the effect on recruitment, retention, and operations of employees in the New York Field Division of the FBI caused by the usual living expenses associated with such employment. Title VI: Defense Intelligence Personnel Improvements - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay a uniform allowance to civilian employees of the Defense Attache Offices located outside the United States. Extends through FY 1989 the Secretary's special authority to terminate the employment of Defense Intelligence Agency employees and Department of Defense military intelligence personnel. Exempts the Defense Intelligence Agency from any requirement to disclose information on its organization, functions, or personnel. States that such exemption shall not apply to any responsibility of the DIA to report to the Congress. Title VII: Study of Intelligence Personnel Systems - Requires the Director of Central Intelligence to contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to review and analyze all personnel management and compensation systems affecting civilian intelligence community personnel. Title VIII: General Provisions - Provides that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Title IX: Mount Alto Embassy Site - Requires the Secretary of Defense to review and assess the present and potential capabilities of the Soviet Union to intercept United States communications from facilities on Mount Alto in the District of Columbia.
