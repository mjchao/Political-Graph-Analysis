  <summary>8/6/1987--Introduced.
Truth in Transportation Trust Funds Act - Prohibits the receipts and disbursements of the Highway Trust Fund (for both the Federal aid highway program and the Mass Transit Account), the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and the Inland Waterway Trust Fund which are allocable to the transportation-related operations of such Funds from being included in either the Federal budget as submitted by the President, or in the congressional budget. Exempts such Trust Funds from any general statutory budget limitation. Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to provide that for deficit calculation purposes such Trust Funds' receipts allocable to transportation-related operations shall be included in fiscal year total revenues and in total budget outlays. Includes in the definition of maximum deficit amount any of such Trust Fund receipts allocable to transportation-related operations which the Director of the Congressional Budget Office projects will be credited to such Trust Funds before October 1, 1989, minus transportation-related disbursements projected to be made before such date. Precludes the Congress from considering within the congressional budget process (including reconciliation vehicles) any amount of budget authority or outlay amount of budget authority or outlay from such Funds. Exempts such Trust Funds from specified enforcement procedures.</summary>
