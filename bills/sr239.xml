  <summary>6/26/1987--Introduced.
Declares that the American people reaffirm their commitment to promoting the development of democracy in all the Americas. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Government of Panama should respond to the points contained in the communique issued on June 17, 1987, by the Panamanian Episcopal Conference; (2) the vital interests of the United States in securing authentic democracy in Panama would be best served by the peaceful establishment of genuine democratic institutions in accordance with the Panamanian constitution; (3) compliance with internationally recognized human rights and the lifting of the suspension of constitutional guarantees are essential preconditions to the restoration of democracy in Panama; (4) an independent investigation into allegations against senior Panamanian civilian and military officials should be conducted by an objective group of Panamanians with authority to publish their findings without delay or fear of reprisal; and (5) the Government of Panama should direct the current commander of the Panama Defense Forces and any other implicated officials to relinquish their duties pending the outcome of the independent investigation.</summary>
