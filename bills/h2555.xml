  <summary>5/28/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to revise provisions that prohibit a State in which a Member of Congress maintains living quarters for purposes of attending congressional sessions from considering such Member as a resident or from treating any compensation paid to the Member as income for State income tax purposes, unless the Member represents the State or one of its districts. Applies these provisions to: (1) the spouse of a Member of Congress who files a joint tax return; and (2) a Member's dependent child whose principal place of abode is that of the Member or the Member's spouse. Includes within the term "Member of Congress" delegates from American Samoa. Applies such provisions retroactively.</summary>
