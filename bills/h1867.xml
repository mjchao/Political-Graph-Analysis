  <summary>3/31/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criminal penalties for the premature release or use of confidential economic information (information which might influence currency exchange rates, interest rates, or the market value of any commodity, future, option, or security) by an officer, employee, or person acting on behalf of the Department of Commerce or other Federal department or agency, knowing that such information is required to be withheld from publication until a fixed time. Provides criminal penalties for the unauthorized receipt and use of such information. Empowers the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) determine which of the information required to be gathered, analyzed, and distributed by the Department might influence currency exchange rates, interest rates, or the market value of any commodity, future, option, or security; (2) establish a time schedule and method for public release of such information; and (3) make rules and regulations to carry out such responsibilities.</summary>
