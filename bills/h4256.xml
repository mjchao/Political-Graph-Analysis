  <summary>3/24/1988--Introduced.
Authorizes employees of the Panama Canal Commission who are U.S. citizens to purchase food and other goods at any commissary or exchange store in Panama which is operated by any military department of the United States. Directs the President, if he finds that the Panamanian Defense Forces have ceased the harrassment of persons in the public areas of Panama and that food and goods are safely available to such employees so that operation of the Panama Canal is not jeopardized, to certify such finding to the Congress. Authorizes the President to terminate such commissary and exchange privileges 30 days after he has given such certification to the Congress.</summary>
