  <summary>5/28/1987--Introduced.
Overseas American Children's Human Rights Act of 1987 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that a person born outside the United States and its possessions to mixed alien and citizen parents shall be a U.S. citizen at birth if the citizen parent was physically present in the United States or its possessions for one year in the aggregate. (Under current law, the parent must have been present for five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of 14 years.) Provides that a child who is under 18 years old at the time of this Act's enactment, and whose U.S. parent fulfilled the one-year requirement at the time of the child's birth, shall be a U.S. citizen. Grants U.S. national and natural-born citizen status to any person born, whether in or out of wedlock, to a U.S. citizen parent outside the United States if such person would otherwise be stateless at birth.</summary>
