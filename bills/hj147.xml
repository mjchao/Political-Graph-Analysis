Authorizes the establishment of a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia honoring American seamen who died while serving on U.S.-flag merchant vessels in conflict zones during hostilities in which the United States was actively engaged. Prohibits the use of Federal funds for expenses unrelated to the maintenance of the memorial. Terminates the authority conferred by this Act if construction of the memorial does not begin within five years of this Act's enactment with funds sufficient to ensure its completion.</summary>
