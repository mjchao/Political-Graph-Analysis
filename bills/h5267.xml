  <summary>9/8/1988--Introduced.
Requires that Medicaid (title XIX of the Social Security Act) payments for inpatient hospital services be no less than 90 percent of the payments that would be made for such services under Medicare (title XVIII). Amends the Medicaid program to prohibit any limitation on the amount, duration, or scope of Medicaid coverage for medically necessary inpatient hospital services. Provides that if Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services are made on a prospective basis, an outlier adjustment in such payment amounts must be made for services involving exceptionally high costs or long stays.</summary>
