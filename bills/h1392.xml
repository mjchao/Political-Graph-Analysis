Requires stockpile requirements to be established by law. Transfers certain stockpiling functions under such Act from the President to the Secretary of Defense. Requires the Secretary to submit to the Congress an annual report on the stockpile requirements. Outlines stockpile matters to be included in each report.</summary>
