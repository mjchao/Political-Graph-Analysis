Authorizes appropriations for capital equipment expenses not related to construction for the following Department of Energy civilian research and development programs: (1) the fossil energy program; (2) the energy conservation program; (3) the energy supply research and development programs associated with renewable energy, supporting research and technical analysis, environmental research and development, nuclear fission energy, and magnetic fusion; and (4) general science and research. Sets forth a specified amount which shall be allocated to the Department's multiprogram and single mission national laboratories to seek out potential users for promising inventions or copyrighted data developed at such laboratories. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Energy for plant and capital equipment for specified prior year civilian research and development projects with respect to: (1) supporting research; (2) nuclear fission; (3) general science and research; and (4) environmental research. Authorizes appropriations for new construction projects. Requires specified reductions in authorizations for general science and research and for nuclear fission. Title II: General Provisions - Prohibits the use of any appropriated funds for the superconducting super collider project. Sets forth limitations on the use of funds authorized under this Act, including that no appropriated amount may be used for any program deleted by the Congress from the President's budget request. Directs the Secretary to treat as reimbursable contractor expenses all costs incurred by civilian energy research and development contractors who respond directly to congressional inquiries. Directs the Secretary to report to certain congressional committees regarding the development of the atomic vapor laser isotope separation process for uranium enrichment under the administration's concept of privatization of the enrichment enterprise. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to issue class waivers for certain inventions or copyrighted materials developed in the performance of a federally funded civilian research and development program.</summary>
