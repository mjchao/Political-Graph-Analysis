  <summary>10/4/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Title I: Library Services and Construction Reauthorization - Amends the Library Services and Construction Act to extend through FY 1989 the authorization of appropriations for grants under title V (Foreign Language Materials Acquisition) and title VI (Library Literacy Programs) of such Act. Title II: National Geography Studies - National Geography Studies Centers Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to enter into a contract with the Education Foundation of the National Geographic Society (the contractor) to pay the Federal share (75 percent) of the cost of establishing and operating National Geography Studies Centers for the study of geography in elementary and secondary schools. Authorizes the contractor to enter into contracts with or make grants to local educational agencies, State educational agencies, State higher educational agencies, institutions of higher education, or consortia thereof, to establish and operate such Centers. Requires each Center to: (1) support programs for geography study by elementary and secondary school students, that may include laboratory schools and summer institutes; (2) support programs which provide elementary and secondary school teacher retraining and inservice training in geography; and (3) establish procedures, through an advisory panel, for selecting students and teachers for Center-supported programs. Requires such procedures to take account of geographic distribution and the needs of students and teachers from historically underrepresented groups. Authorizes each Center to: (1) support development and dissemination of innovative geography curricula; (2) develop geography curricula to be used in other subject areas; and (3) provide technical and resource assistance in geography to schools in the region served. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993 for the National Geography Studies Centers. Title III: United States Institute of Peace - Amends the United States Institute of Peace Act (title XVII of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985) to extend the authorization of appropriations for the United States Institute of Peace through FY 1993. Repeals a prohibition against the use of Federal funds under such Act to pay for private fringe benefit programs.</summary>
