Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain low- and middle-income individuals a refundable income tax credit for the property taxes and rent paid on their principal residences. Requires, for purposes of eligibility, that the taxes and rent paid by such individuals exceed five percent of their adjusted gross income. Limits such credit to $500 for the taxable year. Reduces the credit by five percent of the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $10,000 in 1982, $15,000 in 1983, and $20,000 in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984.</summary>
