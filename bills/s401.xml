  <summary>1/28/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to provide that budget authority proposed to be rescinded or reserved in a special message from the President to the Congress shall be made available for obligation if, within the prescribed 45-day period, the Congress adopts a rescission resolution which disapproves such proposal. (Current law requires such budget authority to be made available unless the Congress passes a bill rescinding it.)</summary>
