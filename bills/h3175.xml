  <summary>8/6/1987--Introduced.
Department of Defense Cost Savings Act of 1987 - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of any military department from operating or allowing a commissary store to be operated on any military installation unless: (1) such installation is located outside a metropolitan area; and (2) not more than one retail store offering the same food supplies as those of the commissary is located within ten miles of the installation. Requires, before the closure or realignment of any military bases occurs, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned to file with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees a concise statement of findings, together with a succinct justification for such action. Reduces from 60 to 30 days the waiting period required after such reports are submitted before any specific closure action may be taken. Maintains the 60-day waiting period with respect to closures in areas with a higher-than-average unemployment rate, or in the case where such closure or realignment would increase unemployment in an area by one percent or more.</summary>
