  <summary>11/9/1987--Introduced.
Forgotten Widows and Survivor Benefits Improvements Act of 1987 - Amends armed forces annuity payment provisions to provide that $165 a month shall be the minimum benefit payable to a surviving spouse eligible for such annuity. Provides that any amount in excess of $165 of an annuity payment shall be considered income under laws administered by the Veterans Administration. Provides the same monthly annuity to certain widows and widowers of persons who became entitled to retired or retainer pay before their death before a certain date, or who chose not to provide their spouse with an annuity and died before a certain date. Prohibits a monthly annuity from being reduced to less than $165 a month when such annuity is reduced because there is no longer a dependent child or because the widow or widower attains age 62.</summary>
