  <summary>7/1/1987--Introduced.
Merchant Marine Support Act of 1987 - Requires that at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage of agricultural commodities and derivative products exported from the United States be shipped in private vessels of U.S. registry, to the extent such vessels are available at competitive rates. Authorizes a waiver of this requirement, but not to exceed six months, when either the Congress or the President declares that an emergency exists justifying such a waiver. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to publish in the Federal Register a list of commodities and products subject to this Act. Terminates this Act's provisions on October 1, 1991.</summary>
