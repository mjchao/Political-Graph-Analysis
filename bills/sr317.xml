  <summary>11/10/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Senate leadership should seek a budget resolution plan that contains savings in FY 1988 in excess of $23,000,000,000 and the plan should extend for at least two years; and (2) the House should consider adopting a similar approach and the President should become personally involved in the negotiations with leaders of Congress to ensure that a meaningful deficit reduction package will be enacted.</summary>
