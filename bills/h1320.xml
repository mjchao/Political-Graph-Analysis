  <summary>1/26/1988--Indefinitely postponed in Senate.
(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Land and Water Conservation Fund Act Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to increase from $10 to $25 the charge for the annual admission permit (the Golden Eagle Passport) into any entrance fee area of the National Park System. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make available an annual admission permit for a reasonable fee for a specific unit or units of the National Park System. Sets fee limits for single-visit permits. Prohibits charging fees at any National Park unit located in an urbanized area. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees a list of units and their proposed admission fees. Prohibits admission fees for persons 16 years of age or less or for organized educational groups. Prohibits charges at: (1) the Statue of Liberty National Monument, New York; (2) the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Hawaii; and (3) Independence National Historical Park, Pennsylvania. Requires a "Fee-Free Day" at each unit where a fee is charged. Sets admission fee limitations for Glacier, Yellowstone, and Grand Teton National Parks. Makes admission fees available to the collecting agency for resource protection, research, interpretation, and maintenance at outdoor recreation facilities managed by that agency. Allocates 15 percent of the funds collected by the National Park Service to Park units based upon need; 35 percent for operating expenses; and 50 percent based on user and admission fees. Permits the use of such funds for resource protection, research, and interpretation, and in the case of funds from user fees, for maintenance. Authorizes volunteers or others to sell permits and collect fees if adequately trained and bonded. Permits the charge of a transportation fee in lieu of an entrance fee at parks with transportation systems. Provides for the distribution of such funds with the park itself retaining 50 percent outright. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of adjusting entrance fees to encourage alternative transportation usage and visitation at off-peak times. Requires the study to include a pilot program at Yosemite National Park. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees within three years on such study. Extends the Land and Water Conservation Fund through FY 2015.</summary>
