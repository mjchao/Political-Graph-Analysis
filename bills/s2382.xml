  <summary>9/9/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Delays until three years after enactment of this Act the implementation of the final rule published in the Federal Register on September 16, 1987, by the Health Resources and Services Administration relating to eligibility for the health care services of the Indian Health Service (IHS). Directs the Office of Technology Assessment, acting in consultation with the IHS, to conduct a study to determine the impact of such rule and any other proposed rules which would change eligibility criteria for services of the Indian Health Service. Requires such study to include: (1) the full participation of, and consultation with, Indian and Alaskan Native tribal governments and representatives of urban Indian health care programs; (2) statistics for each IHS service area on the number of Indians who are currently eligible for IHS services, and who would be eligible for such services if the rule or any alternative rules changing eligibility were implemented; and (3) consideration of the financial impact of any such rule on the contract health care and clinical services budgets of the IHS, the health status, cultural, social and economic impact on Indian reservations and urban Indian populations if any such rule were to be implemented, the alternatives, if any, available to those Indians who would lose eligibility, and the program changes that the IHS would be required to make if the eligibility requirements were modified. Requires the Office of Technology Assessment to submit to the Congress a report on the study within two years after the date of enactment of this Act, after: (1) providing Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and urban Indian health care programs an opportunity to comment; and (2) incorporating the comments into the report. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
