AIDS Health Care Financing Act of 1988 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Public Health Service Act to extend the maximum required period of continuation coverage of group health plans from 18 months to 29 months for an individual determined, under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) or title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act, to have been disabled at the time of termination or reduction in hours. Increases the premium which plans are permitted to require for continuation coverage from 102 percent to 152 percent of the applicable premium for the period for any month after the 18th month of continuation coverage after terminations, reduced hours, or multiple qualifying events. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to permit States to pay expenses of an individual eligible for benefits under its plan for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, or similar costs for health coverage offered by the individual's employer, including continuation coverage. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for a three-year program of grants to States to assist in paying premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar costs for continuation coverage for individuals who were disabled at the time of termination of employment. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Provides that when the Secretary allows a State Medicaid plan to provide for payment for individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or an AIDS-related condition, for home or community-based services such as home health care, personal care services, case management services, outpatient mental health treatment, and outpatient substance abuse treatment, the Federal medical assistance percentage shall not be less than 75 percent. Declares that nothing in title XIX of the Social Security Act shall be construed as preventing a State from establishing differential payment rates for providers to reflect the additional costs of providing services to patients with AIDS or an AIDS-related condition. Directs the Secretary to provide for up to four Regional AIDS Treatment Demonstration Projects for individuals with AIDS and AIDS-related conditions in areas which do not have a disproportionate number of such individuals.
