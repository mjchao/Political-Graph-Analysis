  <summary>7/30/1987--Introduced.
Establishes, effective January 1, 1988, a separate appropriation account in the contingent fund of the Senate to be known as the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (Senators' Account). Transfers to the Senators' Account all moneys available under accounts known as the Senators' Clerk Hire Allowance Account and the Senators' Official Office Expense Account. Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1973 to modify provisions relating to authorized payments from the contingent fund. Includes as new provisions authorization of payments for the following: (1) telecommunications equipment and services subject to regulations as may be promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration; (2) reimbursement for costs incurred in the preparation of required official reports, and the acquisition of mailing lists to be used for official purposes, and in the mailing, delivery, or transmitting of matters relating to official business; (3) reimbursement for expenses incurred for publications printed or recorded in any way for auditory and visual use, including subscriptions to books, newspapers, magazines, clipping, and other information services; (4) reimbursement for expenses incurred for additional office equipment and related services; and (5) reimbursement for charges officially incurred for recording and photographic services and products. Sets forth provisions to address the limitation on salaries and expenses for the transition period of January 1, 1988, through September 30, 1988, and for fiscal years thereafter. Removes the dollar limitation on reimbursable expenses for those individuals selected by a Senator to serve as panelists on nominating boards to make recommendations for nominees for Federal judgeships or service academies. Provides that such expenses shall be treated as a Senators' official office expense. Amends the Legislative Appropriations Act, 1978 to repeal a specified provision which reduces the legislative assistance allowance of a Senator who is chairman or ranking minority member of a committee.</summary>
