  <summary>6/16/1987--Introduced.
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Act of 1987 - Title I: AIDS as a National Public Health Emergency - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to determine that acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presents a public health emergency for purposes of certain provisions of the Act. Authorizes appropriations sufficient to double the amount of the standard level to be in the Public Health Emergency Fund at the beginning of each fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to prepare and transmit to the Congress an annual report on expenditures of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) relating to AIDS, including a description of each program, project, and activity and a description of each grant made and each contract and cooperative agreement entered into. Amends title IV (National Research Institutes) of the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary, through the National Library of Medicine, to establish, maintain, and operate the International Data Bank on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. States that the Data Bank shall collect, catalog, store, and disseminate, through information systems accessible to the public, general practitioners, and investigators, the results of research and treatment regarding AIDS which is undertaken in any country. Requires that such results be available to any person involved in research and treatment relating to AIDS in any country. Directs the Secretary to establish a schedule of charges for users of the Data Bank from other countries. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to establish a virus and serum bank in which all human immunodeficiency virus serotypes and serums are available to qualified investigators. Authorizes the Director to require that any serotype or serum provided under this measure be returned and any information resulting from the use of the serotype or serum be provided to the Director. Authorizes the Secretary, notwithstanding any other law, in accordance with civil service laws, and acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to appoint not more than 40 additional employees to the Food and Drug Administration. Directs the Secretary, through the Public Health Service, to provide technical assistance to State and local governments and public and nonprofit private entities carrying out programs, projects, and activities relating to AIDS. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and 1989. Title II: Training and Services - Amends title XIX (Block Grants) of the Public Health Service Act to add a new subpart on health care services in the home. Authorizes appropriations for activities described in this provision for FY 1988 and 1989. Directs the Secretary, through the Public Health Service, to make allotments to each State, of funds appropriated under such authorization, according to a formula which considers the ratio of the number of individuals with AIDS in the State to the number of individuals with AIDS in all States. Directs the Secretary, in certain circumstances, to make payment of allotments directly to an Indian tribe or a tribal organization and to reserve such direct amounts from allotments to the State. States that amounts paid to a State for a fiscal year and remaining unobligated at the end of the year shall remain available to the State for the next fiscal year. Provides that allotments may be used, with regard to eligible individuals, to: (1) pay compensation for the services of physicians, nurses, and social workers who plan, manage, or provide health care services in the home; (2) identify and locate individuals needing health care services in the home; (3) coordinate health care services in the home with other supportive social services; (4) coordinate other long-term care services provided by public and private institutions and voluntary organizations; and (5) train health care professionals, especially those who may provide home health care services or work in hospices. Authorizes States to use amounts allotted to them to provide health care services in the home for eligible individuals through grants to health care organizations. Prohibits more than ten percent of the total amount allotted and paid to a State under this provision from being used to administer such amount. Requires the State to pay from non-Federal sources the remaining costs of administering the funds. Prohibits use of the allotments to: (1) pay more than a specified amount per year per eligible individual for compensation for the services of physicians, nurses, and social workers; (2) inpatient services; (3) cash payments to recipients; (4) capital purchase or improvement, subject to waiver by the Secretary; (5) satisfy any requirement for expenditure of non-Federal funds; (6) provide services under this provision if the total cost to the Federal Government would exceed the total cost of institutionalizing the individual; (7) provide reimbursement for services performed by any individual other than a physician, nurse, or social worker; or (8) provide social services for which planning and management is conducted under specified provisions of this Act. Directs the Secretary, if requested by a State, to provide technical assistance to the State. Requires a State, in order to receive an allotment, to submit an application to the Secretary. Specifies matters to which the chief executive officer of a State must certify in the application. Requires the chief executive officer of a State to prepare and furnish the Secretary with a description of the intended use of the payments the State will receive under the allotment. Requires that the description be made public so as to facilitate comment from any person during development and after transmittal. States that existing provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to reduction in payments to States, reports and audits, withholding of funds for cause, nondiscrimination, and criminal penalties for false statements shall apply to this new subpart. Requires reports submitted under this provision to include an analysis of the cost effectiveness of providing health care services in the home. Directs the Secretary to conduct evaluations of services provided and activities carried out with payments to States under this subpart. Authorizes the Secretary to use funds from the Public Health Emergency Fund to purchase, on behalf of and at the request of a State, large quantities, at bulk rates, of drugs for the treatment of AIDS, when doing so is more economical than the purchase of the drug by the State. Requires the Secretary to provide the purchased drugs to the State at the cost paid by the Secretary and to deposit the amount received from the States in the Fund. Amends Part F (relating to grants and contracts) of title VII (Health Research and Teaching Facilities and Training of Professional Health Personnel) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary, through the Public Health Service, to make grants to and enter into contracts with schools of medicine and osteopathy to: (1) train faculty of schools of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, public health, and allied health, and faculty of programs for the training of physician assistants, to teach students, in such schools and programs, to provide care and treatment, including counseling and prevention, for individuals with AIDS; and (2) develop and disseminate curricula relating to care and treatment of such individuals. Directs the Secretary, in making grants, to give preference to projects which will: (1) train health professionals who will provide treatment for minority individuals with AIDS and other individuals who are at high risk of contracting AIDS; and (2) train minority health professionals to provide treatment for individuals with AIDS. Prohibits making grants or contracts unless an application is submitted to the Secretary. Makes applications for grants or contracts subject to peer review by groups composed principally of non-Federal experts.

Title III: Public Information - Amends Part B (Federal-State Cooperation) of title III (General Powers and Duties of Public Health Service) of the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary, through the Public Health Service, to develop and disseminate, through the print and broadcast media, public service announcements which inform the public, discourage high risk behaviors, and encourage individuals who may be at risk for contracting AIDS to be tested for infection and to receive counseling regarding infection. Directs the Secretary to: (1) place special emphasis on announcements directed toward minority individuals and individuals at high risk of contracting AIDS; and (2) use appropriate private organizations and businesses.
