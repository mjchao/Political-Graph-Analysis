  <summary>3/18/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Military Selective Service Act to require of any contractor contracting with an agency, department, or instrumentality of the United States that such contractor must solicit certain information regarding registration with the Selective Service from each applicant for employment to any person required to register who has not done so. Requires contractors, for a period of one year after the end of the contract, to furnish, upon request of the Director of the Selective Service System, information on those persons employed with such contractor who stated that they were properly registered with the Selective Service. Authorizes the President to waive the applicability of this Act in the interest of national security. Makes this Act inapplicable to a contract or subcontract with a firm that has fewer than 300 employees.</summary>
