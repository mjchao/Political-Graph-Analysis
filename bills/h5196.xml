  <summary>8/10/1988--Introduced.
Excellence in Presidential Appointees Management Act - Amends Federal law to include, as a condition for designating a civil service position as a career reserved position (one reserved for a career appointee), that such position must have the principal responsibility of managing career employees. Requires that calculation for the number of noncareer appointees allowable in an agency be based upon the number of senior executives employed in the Senior Executive Service in such agency at the end of the preceding fiscal year. Establishes a formula for determining the average number of senior executives to be employed in Senior Executive Service positions during a fiscal year. Establishes a temporary alternative limitation for the period beginning on January 20, 1989, and ending at the end of FY 1990, on the number of Senior Executive Service positions which may be filled by noncareer appointees. Limits the maximum number of positions excepted from the competitive service because of their confidential, policy-making, or policy-determining character to 1,000. Declares that such limitation does not apply to any position which is in grade GS-12 or lower. Directs the Office of Personnel Managment (OPM) to report to specified congressional committees with respect to any individual who is appointed to a position within the competitive service or to the Senior Executive Service as a career appointee if, at any time during the six-month period ending on the effective date of the appointment, such individual served under a noncareer appointment in any agency, including the Executive Office of the President. Directs OPM to establish a qualifications review board to certify the executive qualifications of candidates for initial appointment as noncareer, limited term, or limited emergency appointees. Requires the Director of OPM to establish a training program designed to acquaint noncareer appointees with government operations, civil service procedures, public management practices, and ethical standards for public servants.</summary>
