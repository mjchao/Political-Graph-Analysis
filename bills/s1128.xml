  <summary>5/5/1987--Introduced.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 - Authorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for FY 1988 and 1989. Sets forth allocation guidelines for specified programs. Prohibits the Commission from using more than one percent of such appropriations to enter into grants and cooperative agreements with universities. Authorizes the Commission to: (1) reallocate funds among the specified programs according to prescribed guidelines (including a requirement to notify certain congressional committees of any intent to exceed certain allocation limits); (2) use moneys earmarked for certain programs for purposes of salaries and expenses associated with such programs; and (3) transfer appropriated amounts to other Federal agencies for salaries and expenses incurred by such agencies for activities for which such appropriations of the Commission are made. Directs the Commission, as of FY 1988, to assess and collect user fees in an amount that approximates 50 percent of the Commission's budget. Requires any person who: (1) receives special benefits from the Commission to pay user fees to cover Commission costs in providing those benefits; or (2) holds certain licenses authorizing the operation of a utilization facility with specified thermal rating capacity to pay an annual fee in addition to the user fees. Prescribes the make-up of the annual fee, including assignment of costs based on the principle that those licensees who require the greatest expenditures of Commission resources should pay the greatest annual fee. Mandates that the user and annual fees be deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to repeal the Commission's mandate to submit a feasibility study regarding annual charges, and to collect user charges based upon such report.</summary>
