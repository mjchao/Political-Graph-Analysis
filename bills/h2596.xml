(Measure passed Senate, amended) Admiralty Island National Monument Land Management Act of 1988 - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into land acquisition agreements and cooperative agreements with Kootznoowoo, Inc., to improve the management of Federal lands on Admiralty Island, Alaska. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within 18 months on the status and results of negotiations with Kootznoowoo. Requires any lands on Admiralty Island acquired by the United States under this Act to be incorporated within the Admiralty Island National Monument. Authorizes land exchanges to consolidate Federal land ownership. Renames the Admiralty Island National Monument Wilderness as the Kootznoowoo Wilderness. Provides a legislative settlement to litigation between Kootznoowoo, Inc. and the Secretary over the ownership of the Angoon Administrative Site. Confirms in the United States all rights, title, and interest to land lying within specified boundaries and specified lands within such site adjacent to the mean high tide line of Kootznoowoo Inlet which the Secretary dictates for uses related to administration of the Tongass National Forest. Conveys the remainder of such lands to Kootznoowoo, Inc. by quitclaim deed. Retains an easement for road and utility access.</summary>
