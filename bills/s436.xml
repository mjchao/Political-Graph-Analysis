Limits the Board's administrative costs to a specified percentage of total emergency housing appropriations in any given year. Requires the Board to establish and publish annually written guidelines for various board responsibilities, including methods for determining those localities having the greatest need for emergency housing assistance and for allocating grant funds to them.
