  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Constitutional Amendment - Requires the Congress, prior to each fiscal year, to adopt a statement for that year in which total outlays are not greater than total receipts. Permits the Congress, by a three-fifths vote of each House, to provide for a specific excess of outlays over receipts in such statement. Prohibits actual outlays from exceeding the outlays set forth in such statement. Prohibits total receipts in such statement from increasing by a rate greater than the increase in national income in the previous year, unless a bill directed solely to approving specific additional receipts is enacted. Permits the Congress to waive the provisions of this Act for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect.</summary>
