  <summary>10/22/1988--Indefinitely postponed in Senate.
(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Title I:- Shore Protection Act of 1988 - Requires vessels carrying municipal or commercial waste within U.S. waters to obtain a vessel identification number (permit) from the Coast Guard and display such number on the vessel in a clearly visible manner and location. Sets the permit term at a renewable five years and authorizes the Coast Guard to collect administrative costs from a vessel owner. Provides that the Coast Guard is authorized to, and, at the request of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), required to deny a permit to any vessel for which the owner or operator has a record of a pattern of serious violations of this title or certain other Federal environmental laws. Requires that owners or operators of waste sources make sure that waste material is properly loaded, secured, and offloaded. Requires the EPA to promulgate regulations further defining such responsibilities. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this title as well as actions that the Coast Guard and EPA are authorized to take to enforce this title. Directs the EPA to conduct a study and report to the Congress, within two years of this Act's enactment, regarding the need for and effectiveness of additional tracking systems for vessels to assure that municipal and commercial waste is not disposed of in U.S. waters. Directs the Coast Guard to conduct a study and report to the Congress, within two years of this Act's enactment, on the relative effectiveness and costs of the various vessel tracking systems. Requires the Coast Guard to make periodic checks for vessel permits, make sure of vessel compliance with this title and applicable Federal environmental laws, and require the installation of appropriate tracking devices. States that this title does not: (1) affect other Federal and State laws; or (2) preclude actions by any person or State or local authority for violations of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990. Title II: - New Jersey-New York Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 - Requires the EPA to establish a demonstration program, within nine months of this title's enactment, to track, by the use of a manifest system, medical waste generated and disposed of in New York and New Jersey. Makes such program applicable to generators of medical waste and owners and operators of facilities for the treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of medical waste. Requires such parties to permit access to and provide copies of all records relating to such wastes to any designated representative of the EPA. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of this title. Provides that this title does not preclude any State or locality from imposing more stringent requirements for the control or monitoring of medical waste, or affect the authorities or requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Requires the EPA to report to the Congress, within three years of this title's enactment, on the progress and success of the demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1989 through 1991.</summary>
