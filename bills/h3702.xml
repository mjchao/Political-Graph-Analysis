Limits to $25,000 the amount of loan repayments for each year of obligated service an individual agrees to service.

Provides that no period of internship, residency, or other advanced clinical training shall be counted toward satisfying a period of obligated service.

Entitles the United States to recover specified damages from an individual who breaches his contract by failing either to begin a period of obligated service or to complete such a period. Provides that any obligation of an individual under the Loan Repayment will be cancelled upon his death. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or suspend any obligation under the Program if compliance is impossible or would involve extreme hardship. Describes conditions permitting obligations under the Program to be released by a discharge in bankruptcy.
