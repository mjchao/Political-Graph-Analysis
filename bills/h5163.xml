Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to declare that any increase in the rates of pay of Members which corresponds to an increase in the rates of pay in the General Schedule shall become effective only after enactment of a joint resolution that: (1) relates only to the issue of the increase in such pay rates; and (2) is recorded to reflect the vote of each Member.
