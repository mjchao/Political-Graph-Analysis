Lists permissible real estate activities of bank and nonbank affiliates of holding companies. Specifies that the benefits of Federal deposit insurance coverage applicable to a bank affiliate shall not be extended to its holding company or to any affiliate of a holding company that is not a bank affiliate. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to specify that Federal Reserve member banks shall be subject to the same restrictions as to discriminatory credit treatment as are applicable to bank holding companies and their affiliates under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the National Housing Act to prohibit any insured bank or thrift institution from engaging in any activities or transactions that may not be engaged in by a bank affiliate under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Prohibits the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) from issuing any regulation, order, interpretation, or opinion to the effect that particular activities or transactions do not constitute securities activities. Specifies that only the SEC shall have such authority. Requires the Chairmen of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the FHLBB and the Comptroller of the Currency to serve as a coordinating committee to develop and prescribe procedures for the restructurings required by this Act, particularly the transfer of existing securities activities into securities affiliates, subject to the oversight and regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
