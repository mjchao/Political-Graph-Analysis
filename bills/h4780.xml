  <summary>6/9/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to provide homeless women, infants, and children with access to the special supplemental food program (the program). Provides that the program shall be supplementary to receipt of meals from soup kitchens, shelters, or other emergency food assistance programs. Makes information on program participation by homeless families part of the biennial report on the program by the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to the Congress. Requires State operation and administration plans to include plans to provide program benefits to, and meet the nutrition education needs of, eligible homeless individuals. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures under which eligible homeless individuals may continue to participate in the program when they are in States other than the State in which they were originally certified. Makes each State agency responsible for administering the program for populations of homeless individuals within its jurisdiction. Includes organizations and agencies serving homeless individuals among the entities to which State and local agencies must distribute information on the availability of program benefits. Requires that the special needs and problems of homeless individuals be taken into account in the prescription of appropriate supplemental foods by a competent professional authority. Authorizes the State agency to adopt methods of delivering program benefits to accommodate the special needs and problems of homeless individuals. Directs the State agency to ensure that shelters or institutions in which program participants reside do not: (1) accrue any financial or in-kind benefit from such participation; (2) use food items purchased with program assistance for communal feeding; (3) receive program assistance for participants or use program assistance to such participants for the bulk purchase of food items, except under circumstances defined by the Secretary; and (4) restrict participant ability to partake of food items purchased with program assistance or to participate in all services offered to program participants under the Act. Directs the Secretary annually to report to the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition on plans to ensure that eligible homeless individuals (as well as eligible members of migrant populations) continue to participate in the program as such persons move among States.</summary>
