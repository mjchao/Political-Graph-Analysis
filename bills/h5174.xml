Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) reserve from the funds available for distribution for each fiscal year an amount equal to one percent of such funds to meet emergency and unforeseen contingencies; and (2) restrict the expenditure of such funds to education services or programs at a school site. (Current law does not specify any percentage of funds to be reserved or place such restriction on the expenditure of such funds.)

Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Indian Education Act of 1988 concerning: (1) grants to local educational agencies; (2) special programs and projects to improve educational opportunities for Indian children, including fellowships for Indian students and the establishment of centers for gifted and talented Indian students at tribally controlled community colleges; and (3) definitions. Amends the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 to provide that such Act shall not be construed to affect the obligation of the Bureau to implement legislative provisions enacted before April 28, 1988. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 concerning: (1) the use of Bureau facilities; and (2) the White House Conference on Indian Education.
