Standardization of Measurement Act of 1988 - Directs the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology): (1) within 60 days of this Act's enactment, to survey and evaluate existing standards for high strength steel bolts, and other fasteners, if appropriate; and (2) to submit to the appropriate congressional committees and implement, in coordination with voluntary standardization and testing organizations, recommendations for new tests and subgrades for improving standardization of bolt measurement. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, within 180 days of enactment, to establish within the NBS (NIST) a program for accreditation of bolt testing laboratories. Mandates that, effective January 1, 1991, only bolts meeting these standards may be certified as high strength steel bolts.</summary>
