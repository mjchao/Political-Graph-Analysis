  <summary>1/29/1987--Introduced.
Declares that State prison authorities have an obligation to provide prisoners with a marketable job skill and basic literacy. Prohibits parole authorities from releasing State prisoners sentenced to two years' or more imprisonment unless the State has made reasonable efforts to meet such obligation. Directs the U.S. Attorney General to set forth regulations to carry out this Act, including a determination of what constitutes "marketable job skill" and "basic literacy." Establishes a State Prison Vocational Skills Advisory Council to advise the Attorney General. Conditions Federal assistance for State prison programs on compliance with this Act.</summary>
