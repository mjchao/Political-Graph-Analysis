Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, at the request of an eligible State agency, to enter into agreements to make Federal employee health benefits available to participants (including annuitants) in a private health care plan administered by such agency. Describes an eligible State agency as one that administers: (1) an unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act; and (2) a retirement system that is closed to new participants and funded (in whole or in part) by payments to States for unemployment compensation under the Social Security Act.</summary>
