Imported Meat Inspection Reciprocity Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to investigate the meat inspection requirements of countries which export meat to the United States to determine whether a country applies standards to U.S. meat that: (1) are not substantiated by reliable analytical methods; or (2) are different from standards applied to domestic meat. Authorizes the House or Senate agricultural committees also to request such investigation. Directs the Secretary, upon such findings, to: (1) notify the Congress; and (2) prohibit such country from exporting meat to the United States the Secretary certifies that such meat has met applicable U.S. domestic inspection standards.</summary>
