Federal Constitutional Convention Applications Act - Requires an application by a State for a constitutional convention to contain a certified resolution which requests a convention for: (1) the general purpose of considering amendments to the Constitution; or (2) consideration of amendments to the Constitution relating to one or more specified subjects. Sets forth a procedure for States in the adoption or rescission of a resolution requesting the calling of a convention. Provides for the transmittal of an application to the congressional committees on the Judiciary and for its printing in the Congressional Record. Declares that an application is effective for seven years after the date it is printed in the Record. Requires that both Houses of Congress agree to a concurrent resolution calling for a convention whenever they determine that at least two-thirds of the States have submitted valid applications for the calling of a constitutional convention upon the same subject.</summary>
