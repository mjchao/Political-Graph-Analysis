  <summary>3/16/1988--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on Governmental Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 100-301) Federal Employee Compensation Equity Study Commission Act of 1987 - Establishes the Commission on Compensation Equity to provide for a consultant to study the classification, grading, and pay-setting processes within and between the position classification system and the job-grading system. Requires the study to determine whether these processes result in the payment of rates of basic pay for positions: (1) in which either sex is numerically predominant or any race or ethnic group is disproportionately represented; and (2) where such differences in pay are not in proportion to the duties, difficulty, responsibility, or qualification requirements of the work performed. Provides a timetable for: (1) the Commission to report to appropriate congressional committees and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management with advisory recommendations; (2) the Director to report to the committees and the Commission with a detailed response to each of the Commission's recommendations; and (3) additional comments from the Commission and its termination. Makes specified funds appropriated to the Office of Personnel Management available to pay the Commission's expenses.</summary>
