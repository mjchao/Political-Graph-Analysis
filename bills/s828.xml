(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 2472 passed in lieu) Authorizes appropriations for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for FY 1988 and 1989. Requires the NTIA to establish semiannual goals for recruiting and hiring minorities and women for its staff and to make semiannual progress reports to specified House and Senate committees. Requires the Administrator of the NTIA to: (1) discuss with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the feasibility of awarding public television facilities program grants for low-power translator stations and television translator stations (conditional on the FCC's approval of a license for the station); (2) work with the FCC to expedite the schedules for considering such grants and licenses; and (3) report to the Congress on the implementation of these requirements. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to acquire the satellite services necessary to re-establish the Pan-Pacific Educational and Cultural Experiments by Satellite (PEACESAT) Program. Permits the PEACESAT program to operate for three years over the UHF frequencies currently assigned to the Department of the Navy. Authorizes the Secretary to give the PEACESAT program funding adequate for its operation. Requires PEACESAT managers to maintain the records needed to permit the Secretary to conduct an audit. Authorizes FY 1988 and 1989 funds for acquiring and developing the necessary satellite services for PEACESAT. Requires the Secretary to consult with Federal agencies, PEACESAT program representatives, and other affected parties concerning a long-term solution to the communication needs of the Pacific Ocean region and to report to the Congress on results within one year after enactment of this Act.</summary>
