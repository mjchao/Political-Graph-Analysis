  <summary>3/21/1988--Introduced.
Pesticide Monitoring Improvements Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to implement computerized data management systems for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate and revise its programs for monitoring pesticide residues in food products. Requires the FDA to use such system to summarize information on: (1) the types, amounts, and origins of food products tested; (2) the types and amounts of pesticides detected; and (3) the rate of violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and their disposition. Requires the Secretary to make summarized data from such system available to interested agencies and persons on an annual basis. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require specified agricultural commodity importers to file with the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury an import document identifying the pesticide chemical used in the production of the commodity and the names and addresses of the producers. Requires the Secretary, if a sample of a specified agricultural commodity contains a pesticide chemical which is not reported in the import document, to require that subsequent shipments of such commodity from the same producer be accompanied by results of an analysis designed to detect the levels of such chemical and other chemicals used on, or in connection with the production of, such commodity. Makes such requirements inapplicable if the Secretary determines that the pesticide chemical is present in the commodity as a result of long-term environmental persistence and that the residue levels do not pose a risk to public health. Defines "special agricultural commodity" as a fresh fruit or vegetable, the juice or concentrate of a fruit or vegetable, and any other food included by the Secretary by regulation under this Act. Lists criteria by which the Secretary may determine food to be included in such definition. Directs the Secretary to keep current information on the contents and administrators of pesticide registration and monitoring programs of countries which export significant quantities of food to the United States. Requires the Secretary to keep the FDA and such countries informed of information compiled, including violations. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and report to the appropriate congressional committees on a research plan for pesticide analytical methods.</summary>
