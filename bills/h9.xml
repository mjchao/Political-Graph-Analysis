  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
User Tax Equity Act of 1987 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to prohibit the House of Representatives or the Senate from considering any concurrent resolution on the budget which includes any budget process enforcement device restricting any legislation which: (1) provides new spending authority, if the budget authority for resulting outlays is derived from a trust fund funded by specified tax receipts and if the sum of the anticipated tax receipts plus the existing revenues and unobligated balance of the trust fund exceeds the sum of the estimated new obligational authority plus the existing obligational authority to be derived from the trust fund; or (2) provides new budget authority derived from a trust fund funded by specified tax receipts, if the amount of such new budget authority plus the existing revenues and unobligated balance of the trust fund exceeds the estimated new budget authority plus the existing obligational authority to be derived from the trust fund. Prohibits either House from considering any concurrent resolution on the budget which includes reconciliation instructions requiring a reduction in spending authority derived from any trust fund funded by specified tax receipts below the amount of the revenues and unobligated balance of the trust fund. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to exempt from reduction under any sequestration order payments from trust funds funded by specified tax receipts.</summary>
