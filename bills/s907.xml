Title III: Advanced Technology Program - Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to direct the Secretary, through the Director of the Institute and with the advice of the Assistant Secretary for Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, to establish an Advanced Technology Program to assist U.S. industry in creating the generic technology necessary to: (1) commercialize economically significant new scientific discoveries and technologies rapidly; and (2) refine advanced manufacturing technologies. Directs the Secretary, for such purposes and subject to specified limitations, to enter into contracts with small businesses and to aid the creation and operation of joint research and development ventures by U.S. companies. Sets forth provisions for advisory mechanisms. Title IV: Reports on Semiconductors, Superconductors, and Advanced Manufacturing Technology - Directs the President, at the time of the FY 1989 budget request, to report to the Congress on the President's policies and budget proposals regarding research in semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology, fiber optics and optical-electronic technologies generally, and superconducting materials. Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts with the National Academies of Engineering and Sciences for a thorough review of all major policy issues regarding U.S. semiconductor technology and commercial and national defense applications of superconductors. Provides for a semiconductor review panel and a superconductor review panel. Requires the panels to report to the President and the Congress.
