  <summary>2/5/1987--Introduced.
Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to provide for the payment of widow's, widower's, mother's, or father's insurance benefits to an otherwise eligible person who would qualify for such benefits as the insured individual's widow or widower, by reason of having lived as that individual's spouse at the time of that individual's death, except for the fact that, at the time of their marriage, such individual already had a legal spouse of whose existence such person was unaware. Prorates such benefits between the widow or widower with whom the insured individual was living at the time of death and another widow or widower on the basis of the relative time each lived with the insured individual as his or her spouse.</summary>
