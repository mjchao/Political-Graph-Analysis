(Measure passed Senate, amended) Stafford Student Loan Default Prevention and Management Act of 1988 - Title I: Default Management - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (the Act) to require default management plans to be developed and carried out by certain guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions with high default rates under part B (the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan Program, formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan Program) of title IV (Student Assistance) of the Act. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to determine the default rates for guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and eligible institutions. Requires those guaranty agencies, lenders, and institutions with default rates in excess of 25 percent to develop and carry out default management plans. Subjects guaranty agencies, lenders, and institutions with high volume default rates which are in the highest five percent by volume of defaulted student loans to program reviews by the Secretary (in the case of guaranty agencies) or by the State guaranty agency (in the case of lenders or institutions). Directs the Secretary (or the State guaranty agency, as the case may be) to develop and implement a default management plan for such guaranty agencies, lenders, or institutions if it is determined that their management practices substantially contribute to the high volume default. Sets forth default management provisions which may be required under such plans. Sets forth procedural requirements relating to such plans. Sets forth plan enforcement procedures, including limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings. Sets forth formulas for the calculation of default rates. Revises definitions of guaranty agency, eligible lender, and eligible institution to disqualify those that fail or refuse to develop default management plans. Title II: Improved Stafford Student Loan Collection Provisions - Requires each eligible institution to transmit financial aid transcripts (necessary for loan need determination statements) within 30 days of receiving a request from another such institution. Requires lenders or holders of the loan to notify the borrower, within 180 days after the student borrower leaves the eligible institution, of the month in which the repayment period begins, for both federally-insured student loans (FISL loans) and guaranteed student loans under the Stafford program (Stafford loans). Requires lenders of Stafford loans to notify the guaranty agency (and the borrower, if the loan is to be paid at a new address) of any sale or transfer of the loan to another holder, and the address and phone number through which to contact such other holder concerning loan repayment, within 60 days of such sale or transfer. Prohibits guaranty agencies from selling lists of student borrowers under the Stafford Student Loan program Authorizes guaranty agencies, when the location of a student borrower is unknown or unavailable to them, to enter into agreements for the appropriate State licensing board to provide that information. Eliminates loan repayment deferments that are based on the status of the child rather than the parent, under the parent loan (PLUS) program. Requires lenders to obtain a credit check of applicants for PLUS loans. Allows the lender to charge the applicant for the actual cost of such credit check, up to $25. Requires applicants with negative credit histories to obtain credit-worthy cosigners. Requires an administrative fee, not to exceed five percent of the principal, to be charged to the borrower and paid to the Secretary by the lender, under the Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) and PLUS loan programs.

Sets forth additional requirements with respect to disbursement and endorsement of student loans. Requires multiple disbursement of student loans under the Stafford Student Loan program. Requires that any such loan for $1,000 or more for an enrollment period ending more than 180 days or six months after the disbursement date, be disbursed in two or more installments, none of which exceeds one-half of the loan. Requires a minimum interval between the first and second installments. Requires such interval to be at least one-half of the enrollment period, except as necessary to permit disbursement of the second installment at the beginning of the second semester, quarter, or similar division of such enrollment period. Sets forth requirements for the initial disbursement and endorsement. Prohibits endorsement of the first installment to a new student borrower entering the first undergraduate year until 30 days after the borrower begins a course of study, but allows such installment to be delivered to the eligible institution prior to the end of the 30-day period. Prohibits disbursement of loans to any other student more than 30 days before the beginning of the enrollment period. Sets forth requirements for methods of multiple disbursement. Requires the lender or escrow agent to withhold a second or succeeding installment if the borrower has ceased to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. Provides that all loans issued for the same enrollment period shall be considered a single loan for specified purposes. Excludes from such additional disbursement requirements parent (PLUS) loans, consolidation loans, and loans to cover study at an institution outside the United States. Provides for transmittal of institutional disbursement schedules to lenders. Applies such additional disbursement requirements to the Stafford and FISL loan programs. Establishes an extended collection demonstration program under the Stafford Student Loan program. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with guaranty agencies to establish up to three demonstration programs for extended efforts to reduce defaults on delinquent Stafford student loans.

Requires eligible lenders to furnish appropriate eligible institutions and guaranty agencies with lists of delinquent Stafford loan borrowers within 120 days of the date on which the loan is delinquent. Requires student borrowers to provide the lender at the time of loan application with their driver's license number and the name and address of their next of kin.
