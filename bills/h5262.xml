  <summary>9/8/1988--Introduced.
Temporary Emergency Wildfire Suppression Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to enter into reciprocal agreements with foreign fire organizations to provide wildfire protection resources for lands and other properties for which such Secretaries or organizations normally provide such protection. Requires that such agreements allow for termination of the agreement by any party thereto after reasonable notice. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, in the absence of such agreement, to furnish emergency wildfire protection resources to any foreign nation and to accept such assistance from any foreign fire organization when to do so is in the best interest of the United States. Authorizes the reimbursement of Canada or Canadian fire organizations for U.S. wildfire protection pursuant to a specified memorandum and arrangement with Canada. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to determine that no U.S. fire organization is reasonably available to provide such protection before spending funds for foreign wildfire protection.</summary>
