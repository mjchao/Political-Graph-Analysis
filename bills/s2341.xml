  <summary>4/28/1988--Introduced.
Repeals the limitations enacted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on individual retirement account (IRA) deductions for active participants in certain pension plans. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit a nonworking or the lesser-earning spouse filing a joint income tax return to include the spouse's compensation in calculations made to determine the maximum amount permitted as a deduction for qualified retirement contributions (thus permitting such a taxpayer to deduct up to $2,000).</summary>
