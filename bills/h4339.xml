  <summary>3/31/1988--Introduced.
Japanese Market Expansion Act of 1988 - Imposes a limit on imports of Japanese automobiles unless the Secretary of Agriculture finds and certifies to the Congress that Japan has: (1) removed all quotas and significantly reduced tariffs on fresh, chilled, and frozen U.S. beef; (2) reduced significantly the activities of the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation that result in U.S. beef being uncompetitively priced in the Japanese market; (3) removed all quotas on fresh, chilled, and frozen U.S. fruits and/or fruit juices; and (4) reviewed all nontariff barriers on fresh, chilled, frozen, and preserved U.S. vegetables, and has taken significant action to bring the import standards applied to such products into conformity with those applied by other nations for like products. Declares that such limit shall continue until the Secretary certifies to the Congress that Japan has removed such quotas and nontariff trade barriers.</summary>
