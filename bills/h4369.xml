  <summary>4/13/1988--Introduced.
Amends estate tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a decedent shall be treated as having an interest in a noncharitable gift check cashed after the decedent's death (which interest would be includible in the value of the gross estate) only if the decedent would be so treated if the gift were a charitable one. Applies this provision retroactively to checks issued after December 31, 1981, with respect to decedents dying after that same date.</summary>
