  <summary>4/20/1988--Introduced.
Foreign Anti-Drug Corruption Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that a description of a foreign government's involvement in bribery and official corruption which facilitates the production, processing, or shipment of controlled substances be included in the annual reports of the President to the Congress concerning the involvement of foreign governments in illicit drug trafficking. Requires that findings concerning a foreign government's efforts to prevent, punish, and eliminate bribery and official corruption which facilitate the production, processing, or shipment of controlled substances be included in any certification of the President that a foreign government is cooperating with the United States in preventing illicit drug trafficking. (Current law requires the reduction of American economic assistance and other sanctions against countries which are not certified as taking specified actions to cooperate in preventing illicit drug trafficking.) Requires the President, in making such a certification, to consider whether a foreign government has taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the production, processing, or shipment of controlled substances, as evidenced by the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting such conduct. Amends provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 which provide for trade sanctions against countries determined to be uncooperative drug-producing or drug-transit countries to require that identical findings be made in the certifications of the President required under such Act.</summary>
