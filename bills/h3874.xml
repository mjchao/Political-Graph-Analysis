  <summary>1/27/1988--Introduced.
Parental Assistance With Tuition Bonds Act of 1987 - Amends Federal law relating to savings bonds and savings certificates to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Tuition Bonds, a series of savings bonds, to be offered at varying maturities. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit an individual income tax deduction for the full amount paid to purchase Tuition Bonds, which must be owned by an eligible dependent under age 19. Decreases the permissible deduction for taxpayers having adjusted gross income above $30,000. Limits the amount of the deduction based on the number of persons under age 19 claimed as exemptions by the taxpayer, with a maximum of $10,000 and a minimum limit of $2,000 per person. Permits the deduction to taxpayers who do not otherwise itemize deductions. Excludes from gross income any amount received on Tuition Bond redemption to the extent these proceeds are used to pay attendance costs (tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board) of the taxpayer-bondholder at any institution of higher education or postsecondary vocational school. Establishes penalties in the form of additional tax with respect to Tuition Bond redemption proceeds not used for educational purposes. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop activities to support participation in the Tuition Bond program; (2) encourage payroll deductions for Bond purchase; (3) develop a program to stimulate individuals and both public and private organizations to provide needy children with access to the Bonds; (4) reinstate the Savings Stamp program to enable children to save toward Bond purchases; and (5) implement a system to effect transfer of Tuition Bonds to the relevant institutions.</summary>
