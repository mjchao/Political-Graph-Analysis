  <summary>2/24/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the continued occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union violates international law; (2) on March 21, 1987, the American people should express their continued support for the Afghan freedom fighters; (3) the Afghan freedom fighters should reject Communist offers of a ceasefire and accept only a political settlement that allows the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination; (4) the Soviet Union should accept a timetable of no more than four months for complete withdrawal of Soviet troops; (5) Pakistan should be commended for welcoming Afghan refugees and resisting Soviet pressure; and (6) the United States should continue to support Afghanistan by providing material support. Directs the Secretary of State to develop initiatives to achieve: (1) complete Soviet troop withdrawal and the reestablishment of an independent Afghanistan; and (2) Soviet acceptance of a peaceful political settlement and the return of Afghan refugees. Directs the Secretary to bring the Soviet occupation to the attention of the world, encourage the Communists to remove restrictions imposed on Afghanistan, make efforts to impress upon the Soviet Government the negative effects of the Soviet occupation, and review U.S. policy with respect to continued recognition of the Communist Government in Kabul, Afghanistan.</summary>
