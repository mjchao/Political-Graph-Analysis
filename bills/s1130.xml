Freedom of the Department of Defense Press Act of 1987 - Establishes the Commission on Freedom of the Department of Defense Press (the Commission). Directs the Commission to convene its first meeting within 15 days after the date on which all the members of the Commission have been appointed. Requires the Commission to: (1) examine the editorial policies and operations of the Department of Defense (DOD) and specified newspapers published by DOD in order to determine the amount of censorship and news management permitted within their editorial policies and operations; (2) identify and investigate complaints made to DOD and the Commission by members and former members of the Pacific and European editions of the Stars and Stripes with respect to the presence of censorship and news management practiced by such DOD publications; and (3) determine whether increased civilian participation in the editorial operations of such newspapers will decrease the likelihood of such censorship and news management practices. Directs the Commission, within 90 days after its first meeting, to report to the Secretary of Defense and to the Congress the results of its investigation, together with any appropriate recommendations. Authorizes the Commission to conduct hearings and secure information from various sources in order to aid its investigation. Outlines administrative procedures relating to the meetings and information-gathering powers of the Commission, including the ability to issue and enforce subpoenas; pay, travel expenses, and staff for members of the Commission; and the power to procure temporary and intermittent services in order to carry out its specified duties. Directs the Administrator of General Services to furnish the Commission, on a reimbursable basis, any administrative and support services requested by the Commission. Directs the Commission members, whenever possible, to use military transport when traveling to perform its functions. Terminates the Commission 60 days after the date on which the Commission submits its report, above. Directs payment of Commission expenses to be paid from Department of the Army funds.</summary>
