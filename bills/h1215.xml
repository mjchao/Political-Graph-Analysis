  <summary>2/24/1987--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Navy to comply with a current provision of Federal law which requires the Secretary to take into consideration interport differential costs when evaluating contracts for the proposed overhaul, maintenance, or repair of naval vessels, notwithstanding another Federal provision which prohibits Department of the Navy funds to be used for any such contract in which interport differential costs are used as a factor in such contract.</summary>
