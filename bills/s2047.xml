  <summary>10/22/1988--Indefinitely postponed in Senate.
(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate) Amends the Federal Alcohol Administration Act to set forth the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988. Requires alcoholic beverages that are manufactured for sale or distribution in the United States to have labels bearing a Government warning that: (1) women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects; and (2) consumption of such beverages impairs ability to drive or operate machinery and may cause health problems. Exempts such beverages that are manufactured for export from the United States from such requirement. Empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce this Act. Requires the Secretary, upon finding that available scientific information would justify a change in the warning label, to report such information to the Congress. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to compromise the liability arising from such violations upon payment for each offense to the Treasury. Makes technical and conforming amendments.</summary>
