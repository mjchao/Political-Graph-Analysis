  <summary>6/5/1987--Introduced.
Declares that: (1) proposals by Canada to impose discriminatory limitations on foreign companies to distribute motion pictures in Canada reflect a protectionist trade policy aimed primarily at U.S. motion picture distributors; and (2) such measures are at odds with free trade between nations and could bar completion of negotiations and Senate approval of a Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada.</summary>
