VA Health Care Amendments Act of 1987 - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to redefine "nursing home care" for purposes of eligibility for such benefits. Authorizes the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to provide public or private recreational activity facilities for VA hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care patients. Authorizes the Administrator to furnish domiciliary care to any veteran in need of such care if such veteran is unable to defray the expenses of necessary care. (Currently, only a limited number of veterans, such as disabled veterans or veterans receiving disability compensation, are eligible for such care.) Revises provisions concerning the furnishing of medical treatment to certain disabled veterans.</summary>
