  <summary>3/10/1988--Introduced.
Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program Act of 1988 - Title I: Coordination of Conservation and Commodity Programs - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to increase authorized conservation reserve program acreage. Provides that with regard to the 1988 through 1991 crops of wheat, feed grains, rice, and upland cotton, the total acreage in the conservation reserve program and the environmental conservation acreage reserve program (established by this Act) shall represent at least 80 percent of total idled acreage. Sets forth program enrollment incentives, including: (1) advance payments; (2) bonus payments; and (3) the counting of enrolled acreage against acreage limitation requirements. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to the appropriate congressional committees assessing such programs' implementation. Title II: Administration of the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to limit the amount of conservation program-enrolled cropland in any county. Bases the limit on reduced economic activity associated with such land. Prohibits annual rental payment variations based on the time of program enrollment. Provides for the use of local conservation experts and farmers in determining appropriate cover crops. Directs the Secretary to carry out a land use pilot program for wildlife habitat or outdoor recreational purposes. Authorizes bonus payments for public access to hunting and fishing areas. Amends the Agricultural Programs Adjustment Act of 1984 to direct (current law merely authorizes) the Secretary to implement a program of reamortizing certain distressed agricultural loans with revenues from marginal land timber plantings. Increases program acreage. Title III: Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary to establish an environmental conservation acreage reserve program of between 5,000,000 acres and 20,000,000 acres to foster resolution of water pollution and soil damage and the related problems of siltation, salinity, pesticide contamination, and adverse land use patterns. Authorizes enrolled acreage to be returned to crop production under specified circumstances. Limits fiscal year payments to any individual to $50,000. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual program report to the appropriate congressional committees, with the first report due by June 1, 1989. Title IV: Conservation and General Commodity Provisions - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to require (present law merely authorizes) the Secretary to provide for upward crop acreage base adjustments. Increases the maximum adjustment ceiling. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to include certain alfalfa planted to produce hay and seed within the definition of "agricultural commodity" for certain conservation program purposes.</summary>
