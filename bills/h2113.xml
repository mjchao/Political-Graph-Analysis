Declares that certain provisions of the Social Security Act relating to staffing, administration, and reporting shall apply in the same way to the Commission as they apply to the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary to provide that not less than 25 percent of funds set aside for research and demonstration projects relating to health services delivery or access be used in projects relating to rural areas, except for funds appropriated for the National Institutes of Health or funds first made available before FY 1988.</summary>
