  <summary>9/7/1988--Introduced.
Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act of 1988 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to require that the Federal Government collect OASDI overpayments on a schedule which does not cause financial hardship for the beneficiary. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish one-year demonstration projects implementing accountability procedures for at least three telephone service centers operated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Requires that the Secretary promptly provide callers with a written receipt which sets forth: (1) the name of the SSA representative with whom the caller spoke; (2) the date of the call; (3) a description of the nature of the call; (4) any action which the representative indicates will be taken in response to the call; and (5) the information or advice offered by the SSA representative. Requires that: (1) callers be notified that they will be provided with such receipt; and (2) the SSA retain a copy of such receipt. Sets forth reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to provide OASDI benefit applicants with information concerning the wages and self-employment income on which such benefits are based and notify such applicants that they may submit a challenge under which they will receive a more complete accounting of such information in order that they may demonstrate that some items of wages or self-employment income have been excluded. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Act to require the Secretary, when determining an individual's entitlement to benefits under the Act, to take into account such individual's physical, mental, educational, vocational, or linguistic limitations in determining his or her good faith, fault, fraud, deception, or intent. Amends the OASDI program and title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Act to require the Secretary to establish programs, within 180 days of this Act's enactment, under which homeless individuals who may be eligible for OASDI and SSI benefits will be identified and assisted in applying for such benefits. Directs the Secretary to annually report to the Congress on such programs. Requires that notices issued to individuals pursuant to the OASDI or SSI program: (1) be written in simple and clear language; (2) contain the name, address, and telephone number of a responsible person to contact regarding the notice; and (3) be written both in English and another language if such other language is likely to be the native language of a substantial number of recipients. Provides that individuals who are applying for or receiving OASDI benefits on the basis of blindness may elect to receive notice of decisions made and actions taken with respect to their rights under the program: (1) by certified mail and by telephone five days after such mailing; or (2) by some alternative procedure established by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to: (1) maintain the names of representatives of OASDI and SSI claimants in the SSA's electronic information retrieval system; and (2) provide written notice to such claimants of the availability of attorneys to represent them in presenting their cases before the Secretary. Allows OASDI and SSI claimants to reapply for payments which have been denied if such claimants' failure to request a review of such denials within 60 days of receiving notice of such determinations resulted from good faith reliance upon incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information provided by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary, in notifying claimants of adverse payment determinations, to describe in clear and specific language the consequences of choosing to reapply for payments instead of requesting a review of such determinations.</summary>
