(Reported to Senate from the Select Committee on Indian Affairs with amendment, S. Rept. 100-601) Native American Museum Claims Commission Act - Establishes the Native American Museum Claims Commission as an independent agency to: (1) receive, consider, and determine the facts relative to claims that involve Native American skeletal remains, ceremonial artifacts, or grave goods; (2) facilitate negotiated settlements of such claims; (3) issue orders regarding the right to possess such Native American skeletal remains, ceremonial artifacts, or grave goods; and (4) submit annual reports to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Permits the governing body of any Indian tribe, a consortium of tribes, or the Office of Hawaiian Affairs of the State of Hawaii to file a claim with the Commission for the repatriation from a museum of: (1) the skeletal remains of a Native American or a Native Hawaiian; (2) ceremonial objects of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian group that is a party to such claim; or (3) grave goods from Native American or Native Hawaiian graves. Sets forth procedures and requirements with respect to the negotiated settlement, investigation, dismissal, and resolution of claims. Authorizes the Commission to impose a fine, not to exceed $500 per day, if it determines that a final order to resolve a claim is not being carried out.
