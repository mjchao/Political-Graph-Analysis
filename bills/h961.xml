Prohibits imports of motor vehicles from Yugoslavia until the Secretary of Labor decides that Yugoslavia permits free trade unions. Authorizes the Secretary to make such a decision only if there is conclusive evidence that: (1) workers in Yugoslavia have the right to organize unions and are not hindered from exercising that right by the government; and (2) Yugoslavia affords its workers all other internationally recognized workers' rights.</summary>
