  <summary>11/5/1987--Introduced.
Foreign Intelligence Congressional Notification Act - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to prohibit the use of funds of any U.S. entity for any intelligence activity or significant anticipated activity, unless the Director of Central Intelligence or the head of the entity has: (1) notified the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives of such activity; or (2) notified the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, if the President has made a written determination that it is essential to limit the number of persons given prior notice of the activity to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests. Allows the President to waive such prohibition if he determines in writing that an emergency constituting a grave and immediate threat to national security requires such a waiver. Makes such prohibition inapplicable with respect to an intelligence activity for which funds were specifically authorized by the Congress.</summary>
