  <summary>5/28/1987--Introduced.
Directs the President to determine, within 90 days after Japan approves a national budget for any fiscal year, whether the sums authorized in that budget for the Japanese Self-Defense Forces equal or exceed the minimum acceptable security outlay for that Japanese fiscal year. Defines such minimum outlay as an amount equal to not less than three percent of the gross national product of Japan for that year. Requires the President, if the authorizations do not meet such standard, to: (1) determine the difference between the acceptable outlay and the budget authorization; and (2) impose duties on Japanese imports as necessary to generate customs revenues that are equal to the amount determined under (1). Establishes in the Treasury the Strategic Foreign Aid Fund. Makes appropriations to such Fund in amounts equal to the duties imposed on Japanese imports under this Act. Specifies that amounts in such fund shall be made available for: (1) the carrying out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) obligations of the United States; (2) the carrying out of Pacific Ocean operations by the United States; and (3) the provision of economic and military assistance to certain countries in Central America, the Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific.</summary>
