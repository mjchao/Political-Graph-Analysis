  <summary>2/22/1988--Introduced.
Declares that U.S. policy towards Central America should be based upon a de-escalation of the conflict and upon the following principles: (1) U.S. assistance for the Nicaraguan resistance should be limited to the provision of food, medical supplies, clothing, and shelter to noncombatants; (2) the United States should not provide any direct assistance to the resistance as long as it remains a fighting force; (3) no assistance should be provided by a party to the conflict, the Central Intelligence Agency, or any U.S. Government agency; (4) the United States should provide a substantial amount of humanitarian assistance for the reintegration or resettlement of the resistance after a ceasefire is in place and the members of the resistance have laid down their arms; (5) executive branch officers and employees should not solicit any assistance for the resistance from third countries or private contributors, and the Congress should maintain oversight with respect to third country solicitations; (6) future U.S. assistance for Central American countries should be tied to the resolution of internal conflicts through diplomatic means; and (7) the executive branch should address regional security issues by engaging in bilateral negotiations with Nicaragua, leading to normalized U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.</summary>
