  <summary>12/11/1987--Introduced.
Calls upon the Western European nations that provide assistance to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua to: (1) affirm their support for the Guatemala accord by withholding all direct assistance to the Sandinistas until they are in full compliance with that accord and democratic institutions are established in Nicaragua; (2) reaffirm their commitment to democratic values by directing their economic assistance to support the democratic governments in Central America and by giving political and financial assistance to non-Marxist groups; and (3) reaffirm their commitment to regional cooperation among democratic institutions by channeling financial assistance to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and by funding the Central American Development Organization.</summary>
