  <summary>10/14/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (the Act) to prohibit attempts at (as well as acts of) excavation, removal, damage, or other alteration or defacement of any archaeological resource located on public or Indian lands, without a permit. Lowers to $500 (currently $5,000) the threshold commercial or archaeological value of an archaeological resource (including cost of restoration or repair) above which, for certain violations of the Act, specified criminal penalties are mandated. Directs each Federal land manager to: (1) establish a program to increase public awareness of the significance of, and the need to protect, archaeological resources located on public lands and Indian lands; and (2) report annually to specified congressional committees on actions taken under such program.</summary>
