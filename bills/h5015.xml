  <summary>8/8/1988--Conference report filed in House.
(Conference report filed in House, H. Rept. 100-830) Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 - Title I: Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Act of 1988 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to add a new title VI which may be cited as the Emergency Livestock Feed Assitance Act of 1988. Includes Indian tribes, organizations, and specified enterprises actively engaged in livestock production or dairying within the definition of "livestock producers" for purposes of assistance under this title. States that the term "area" shall include Indian reservations. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide emergency feed assistance in any State, county, or area of a State where disease, weather, or other natural disaster has created a livestock emergency, as determined by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to otherwise eligible producers who conduct farming, ranching, or aquaculture operations in any county contiguous to a disaster-designated county. States that the Governor of a State or a county committee may request the Secretary to make a livestock emergency determination and to provide assistance. Authorizes the Secretary to make such determination on his own initiative. Requires the Secretary to make such determination within 30 days of request and to notify the requesting party of any proposed action. States that producers in counties eligible for the emergency feed or emergency feed assistance programs in 1988 shall maintain such eligibility and be eligible for assistance under this title. Directs the Secretary to determine such counties' eligibility for assistance under this title. States that an eligible producer may receive assistance as follows: (1) assistance to offset inadequate feed stocks resulting from on-farm losses; and (2) assistance to maintain foundation herds if the producer does not have, and is unable to obtain through normal channels without undue cost, necessary feed stocks. Sets forth the following assistance programs available under this title: (1) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) feed donations and reduced price sales; (2) partial reimbursement of feed purchase expenses; and (3) partial reimbursement of transportation and handling costs for such CCC feed, for hay, and for transporting livestock to and from available grazing areas (not to exceed $24 a head). Permits the Secretary to: (1) make in-kind payments; and (2) provide assistance through feed dealers or manufacturers. Authorizes the Secretary to provide the following additional assistance if necessary: (1) CCC feed donations for stranded and unidentified livestock, including transportation costs; (2) water assistance; (3) CCC catalog commodities in lots appropriate to family farmers; and (4) reimbursement for the cost of burning prickly pear cactus to make it suitable for animal feed. Limits total assistance under this title for each livestock disaster to any one person to $50,000. Prohibits assistance to any person with gross annual revenues in excess of $2,500,000. Subjects each person (including individual members of a cooperative producer association) to the overall payment limitation ($100,000) under this Act. Prohibits a person from receiving assistance under this title for lost feed production due to the 1988 drought to the extent that such person receives production disaster payments under this Act. Subjects persons who misuse such assistance to a civil penalty equal to the market value of the involved fee, and a fine of up to $1000 or imprisonment for up to one year, or both. Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to repeal the Secretary's authority to reduce 1989 milk price supports (50-cents per hundredweight). Provides a 50-cent price support increase effective April 1, 1989 through June 30, 1989.
