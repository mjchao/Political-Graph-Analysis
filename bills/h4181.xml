Requires States to report annually to the Secretary on projects undertaken using such payments. Requires that 50 percent of mineral receipts collected from leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska be deposited into such Fund. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the effect of establishing and expanding units of the National Park System in Alaska where sport hunting is prohibited for registered hunting guides.</summary>
