  <summary>5/8/1987--Introduced.
Amends veterans' dependency and indemnity compensation provisions to eliminate any length-of-marriage requirement necessary in order for the surviving spouse of a veteran (and such veteran's children) to be entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation due to the death of certain veterans with service-connected disabilities. (Currently, a surviving spouse must have been married to such veteran for not less than two years before becoming eligible for such benefits.)</summary>
