  <summary>9/22/1987--Introduced.
Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Reporting Act of 1987 - Requires each Federal entity, in the 90-day period beginning on the first October 1 in each five fiscal year period beginning in FY 1988, to send the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission a written plan pertaining to each of the five previous fiscal years with respect to job applications, hiring, training, and promoting of employees. Requires such plan to detail data for each separate component and installation of the entity and for the entity as a whole. Prescribes the contents of such plans, including data for each EEO group on whether underrepresentation, under-utilization, or an adverse impact exists and, if so, data on affirmative action goals for each employment category affected. Requires that, for each fiscal year (after the first) of each five-year period, each Federal entity submit an annual report concerning the status of the entity's plan, including an update on progress made in achieving the goals and timetables specified in such plan. Directs the Commission to review such reports and, if a continuing manifest imbalance is found, to require an entity to: (1) take additional steps to identify and remove barriers to equal employment opportunity; and (2) develop additional affirmative action goals and timetables. Requires the Commission to publish in the Federal Register, by June 1 of 1988 and of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the identity of each Federal entity which fails to file such a plan, and by January 31 of each fiscal year, the identity of each Federal entity that fails to timely submit the report required under such plan. Requires the head of any Federal entity which fails to file such a plan or report to submit a statement of reasons for the failure to the Commission, or to request an informal hearing to state such reasons orally by December 31. Authorizes the Commission to summon witnesses and compel the production of evidence in the course of investigating such failure. Requires the Commission to issue an order mandating the submission of such plan or report by March 31. Directs the Commission to commence a civil action to compel submission of such plan or report if the entity has not complied with the order by April 30. Authorizes any employee of or applicant for employment with such entity, or a labor organization recognized by such entity, to commence a civil action in an appropriate district court to compel the head of the entity to submit such plan or report if the Commission has failed to commence such an action within two years after the appropriate April 30 deadline. Requires the Commission, at least once every five years, to make an on-site examination with respect to at least one component or installation of each Federal entity, of the program management, data collection monitoring and evaluation, personnel practices, barrier analysis, employee training and recruitment, and sexual harassment prevention measures of such entity. Requires the Commission to conduct a full program audit of each Federal entity that: (1) is subject to this Act's filing and reporting requirements and that fails to develop and implement an effective affirmative action plan or to show sufficient progress in carrying out such plan; or (2) receives complaints from a substantial number of employees alleging a violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Requires the Commission to: (1) conduct full program audits of at least five Federal entities per year; (2) communicate its proposed audit findings to the head of the Federal entity audited and allow such entity an opportunity to respond before issuing such findings; (3) include in each such audit a thorough examination of the entity's strategies, procedures, resources, and commitment with respect to affirmative action; and (4) conduct such an audit within one year after commencing a civil action to compel the head of such an entity to submit a plan or report under this Act.</summary>
