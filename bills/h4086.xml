  <summary>3/3/1988--Introduced.
Patent Licensing Reform Act of 1988 - Amends Federal law to deny patent infringement relief to a patent owner who either misuses or illegally extends a patent, until such misuse or illegal extension terminates and the consequences of such conduct have dissipated. Defines the conduct that constitutes "misuse or illegal extension." Declares that it shall be an affirmative defense in a patent infringement action that a person engaged in fraud or other inequitable conduct in procuring or enforcing the patent. Requires the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office to define by regulation the conduct necessary to avoid liability for fraud.</summary>
