Directs the President to transmit to the Congress a staged program to establish conditions under which the rights set forth in this Act may be secured. Requires all Federal departments, agencies, and commissions to plan and carry out their programs in a manner designed to establish and maintain conditions under which such rights may be secured. Requires the Joint Economic Committee to monitor the actions taken under this Act and report its conclusions to the Congress. Establishes the Commission on Economic Rights to: (1) promote education and public discussion of the economic rights set forth in this Act; and (2) study the extent to which new conditions and problems require extensions of or amendments to such rights. Directs the Commission to report to the Congress and the President within two years of enactment of this Act.
