  <summary>5/20/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to apply an interest rate of four percent (the current minimum rate is seven percent) on the unpaid balance of a guaranteed student loan of any borrower who has a deferment to serve as a full-time elementary or secondary teacher in a teacher shortage area. Applies this reduced rate from the end of such deferment until the end of the loan repayment period or until the person ceases full-time teaching, whichever occurs first. Excludes supplemental loans, PLUS loans, and consolidation loans from such treatment.</summary>
