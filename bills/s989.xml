Requires any sales organization recruiting door-to-door sales agents to disclose in writing to such prospective agents specified information, including: (1) the nature of the employment being offered; (2) a description of the consumer goods to be sold; (3) the compensation to be paid; (4) the responsibilities and expected conduct of the sales agent; (5) the financial, including tax, liabilities of both the organization and the agent; and (6) a declaration that the prospective sales agent has a specified period within which to consider an offer to become associated with the sales company. Describes certain records and information that a sales organization must prepare and retain with respect to each of its sales agents. Prohibits a sales organization, in its dealings with any sales agent, from: (1) violating the terms of its written disclosure statement; (2) engaging in threats or acts of reprisal, intimidation, or violence; or (3) refusing to disburse remuneration as due. Vests in the Federal Trade Commission the power to enforce this Act. States that an organization's violation of this Act shall be deemed an unfair and deceptive practice.
