  <summary>3/22/1988--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) should: (1) investigate the management of Texas Air Corporation and Eastern Air Lines since the acquisition of Eastern by Texas Air to determine (according to prescribed guidelines) the effect of such management upon the public interest; (2) use the investigation findings as a basis for decisions in pending and future cases involving proposed changes in domestic and international operations of Eastern; (3) not authorize the operation of any entity as a subsidiary of Texas Air in performing any air transportation operations until completion of a review to determine whether such performance is consistent with the public interest; (4) not authorize any Texas Air subsidiary to engage in air transportation until the application for such certificate has been reviewed; (5) not authorize Orion Air to provide contract services with Eastern unless Orion establishes conclusively its capability of conducting such operations with the highest degree of safety; (6) not expedite consideration of Orion's request to operate under contract with Eastern by diverting employees of the Department of Transportation or the Federal Aviation Administration from their responsibilities of ensuring the safety of previously authorized operations; and (7) require, as a condition of any approval of Orion's request to provide air transportation service under contract with Eastern, that purchasers of tickets for such service must be informed at the time of making reservations of the identity of the carrier having operational responsibility for such service.</summary>
