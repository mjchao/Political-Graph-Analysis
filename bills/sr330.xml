  <summary>11/20/1987--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) all parties in Haiti should refrain from violence and that the National Governing Council (NGC) should bring to justice those responsible for attacks against officials of the Provisional Electoral Council (PEC); (2) the NGC should cooperate fully with the PEC to assure a fair election, free from intimidation and fear; (3) the NGC should provide security and protection, as well as administrative and logistical support, to the PEC; and (4) the President should suspend all military assistance for the Government of Haiti if he determines that the NGC fails to take such steps to assure a free and fair election.</summary>
