  <summary>6/30/1988--Introduced.
Requires a certain percentage of Federal fleets of passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks to be alternative fuel vehicles by specified deadlines if such vehicles are being operated in an area designated under the Clean Air Act as an area of serious health endangerment for ozone and/or carbon monoxide. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Secretary of Defense, with concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, to issue regulations ensuring that such vehicles shall: (1) be supplied with alcohol, natural gas, or electricity in the primary area of operation; and (2) be operated exclusively on such fuel (except when it is impracticable to obtain it). Mandates that funds appropriated to implement this Act be expended first in those areas determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (the Administrator) to have the most severe air pollution problems. Requires alcohol or natural gas fuels to be offered for sale to the public at Federal facilities except in certain circumstances. Mandates that the funds appropriated for alternative fuel vehicle acquisition apply only to the portion of costs which exceeds the cost for comparable conventional fuel vehicles. Directs the Secretary of Energy to ensure that the cost to any Federal agency receiving an alternative fuel vehicle under this Act shall not exceed the cost to such agency of a comparable conventional fueled vehicle. Mandates that gasoline powered Federal vehicles, with specified exceptions, which are operated in an area designated as seriously endangering health because of carbon monoxide, and which are not dual energy (or natural gas dual energy), be operated exclusively with fuel which blends oxygenates with gasoline at their primary fueling facility. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress the results of a comprehensive analysis of the public health risk associated with the use of significant amounts of alcohol or natural gas transportation fuels as compared to diesel and gasoline fuels. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990. Sets forth criteria for alternative fuel vehicles. Authorizes appropriatons for FY 1993 through 1996.</summary>
