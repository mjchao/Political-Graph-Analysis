  <summary>7/22/1987--Introduced.
Health Promotion for Older Americans Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to require the Commissioner on Aging to implement a program making grants to States for the provision of preventive health screening and health education and promotion services at senior centers or, if more appropriate, community centers and alternative sites. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY 1988 through 1991. Requires that States give priority to areas which are medically underserved and where a large number of those with the greatest economic or social need for such services reside. Prohibits the use of such grants on services covered under title XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act. Excludes funds received by individuals by reason of their participation in the community service employment program from consideration as income in determining their eligibility for assistance under the Food Stamp Act of 1977.</summary>
