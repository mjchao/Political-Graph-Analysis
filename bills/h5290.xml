  <summary>9/14/1988--Introduced.
Tech-Prep Education Act - Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to make grants to pay the Federal share of the cost of activities carried out under this Act to consortia of: (1) local educational agencies or area vocational schools serving secondary school students; and (2) community colleges (including postsecondary vocational technical schools). Sets the Federal share at: (1) 100 percent of first year planning costs; (2) 80 percent of second year implementation and operation costs; (3) 70 percent of third year operating costs; (4) 60 percent of fourth year operating costs; and (5) 50 percent of fifth year operating costs. Requires each grant recipient to use the grant funds to develop and operate a four-year technical preparation education program. Requires such program to consist of the two years of secondary school preceding higher education, with a common core of required proficiency in mathematics, science, communications, and technologies designed to lead to an associate degree in a specified career field. Requires such program to include development of appropriate curriculum and in-service teacher training. Allows any such program to provide for counselor training and equipment acquisition. Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires applications to include five-year plans for development and implementation. Directs the Secretary to ensure an equitable distribution of assistance among States and among urban and rural consortium participants but to give special consideration to applications which: (1) provide for effective employment placement activities or transfer of students to four-year baccalaureate degree programs; (2) demonstrate commitment to continue the program after termination of assistance under this Act; and (3) are developed in consultation with business, industry, and labor unions. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993 to carry out this Act.</summary>
