Prohibits the total funds obligated pursuant to this title from exceeding the total amount authorized to be appropriated by this title. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to carry out any authorized general plant construction project only if the maximum estimated cost of the project does not exceed $1,200,000. Requires reports from the Secretary to specified committees when revised costs of a project exceed such amount. Sets forth procedures for the approval of projects which exceed by more than 25 percent their estimated cost, and exempts from such procedures any projects which have an estimated cost of less than $5,000,000. Allows for the transfer of funds from specified projects to other Government agencies for the performance of work for which the appropriation is made. Authorizes the Secretary to perform advance planning and construction design services in connection with any proposed construction project if the total cost does not exceed $2,000,000. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate committees whenever such planning and design exceeds $300,000, and requires specific legislative authorization whenever such services exceed $2,000,000. Authorizes the Secretary to perform emergency construction planning and design to meet the needs of national defense or to protect property or human life. Makes funds authorized for operating expenses and plant and capital equipment under this title available for all national security programs of DOE. Authorizes increases in amounts authorized under this title in order to account for increases in salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits as authorized by law. Part C: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary of Energy to request the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a review of the inertial confinement fusion program of DOE and to submit to the defense committees, no later than January 15, 1990, and September 15, 1990, reports on the results of such review. Directs the Secretary to review such reports and, no later than 30 days after receipt of each, to submit to the same committees comments and recommendations concerning such reports. Directs the Secretary, no later than July 31, 1988, to submit to the defense committees a report containing the Secretary's recommendations for the site for construction of a new production reactor and the Secretary's recommendation for the preferred technology for a new production reactor.

Part D: Independent Nuclear Safety Board Oversight Over Department of Energy Nuclear Facilities - Expresses certain congressional findings relating to the need for independent oversight of safety operations at DOE nuclear facilities. States the purpose of this part to be to establish a Defense Nuclear Safety Board to ensure the protection of public health and safety in activities at DOE nuclear facilities. Establishes such Board, outlining administrative provisions relating to Board composition, functions, powers, and responsibilities. Requires the Board to review and evaluate the implementation of the health and safety standards of DOE at each DOE nuclear facility and to recommend to the Secretary specific measures that should be adopted to reduce substantially the likelihood that actual or potential nuclear incidents will occur. Provides that if the Secretary of Energy determines that any action recommended by the Board or any action proposed by the Secretary in response to the Board's recommendation might affect DOE's ability to meet the annual nuclear weapons stockpile requirements, the Secretary shall inform the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the appropriations and defense committees of the Congress of such recommendation and shall consult with the Secretary of Defense on such action. Outlines further administrative action authorized to be taken by the Board or the Secretary in specified circumstances.
