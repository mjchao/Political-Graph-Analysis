  <summary>3/8/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Merchant Marine Decorations and Medals Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to award decorations and medals for individual acts or service in the U.S. merchant marine. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to award: (1) a Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal for outstanding acts beyond the line of duty; (2) a Merchant Marine Meritorious Service Medal for meritorious acts, but lacking the outstanding character required for the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal; (3) a decoration or medal for service during a war or national emergency or during armed forces operations outside the United States under conditions of danger to life and property; and (4) a decoration or medal to an individual for acts of conspicuous gallantry. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to issue a Gallant Ship Award for actions during marine disasters or emergencies aimed at saving lives or property. Requires consultation with the Secretary of State before issuance of an award or citation to a foreign-flag vessel. Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from awarding more than one of any type of decoration or medal to an individual. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide at cost, or authorize for manufacture and sale at reasonable prices: (1) decorations and medals for individual acts or service in the merchant marine; and (2) replacements for decorations and medals issued under a prior law. Permits the decorations and medals to be of similar design as are authorized for members of U.S. armed forces for similar acts or service. Permits the Secretary of Transportation to issue without cost a U.S. flag and a grave marker to the family or personal representative of a deceased individual who served in the merchant marine in support of the armed forces in wars or national emergencies. Permits the Maritime Administrator to issue a special certificate in recognition of service to an individual whose service in the U.S. merchant marine has been determined to be active duty under specified Federal law. Declares the issuance of such certificate does not entitle the individual to any rights, privileges, or benefits under any U.S. laws. Establishes a civil penalty of $2,000 for unauthorized display, manufacture, possession, or sale of a decoration or medal. Repeals the Merchant Marine Medals Act. Amends Federal law relating to the setting aside of specified surplus government ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet for the use of a private organization for humanitarian services to substitute one ship for another in the designation of which ships are to be set aside. Extends the time to carry out the purposes of the Act until 1992.</summary>
