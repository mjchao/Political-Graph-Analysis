  <summary>4/9/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an individual a nonrefundable income tax credit equal to 25 percent of the amount of expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for new security devices for the taxpayer's residence, including: (1) a lock or alarm for a door or window; (2) security lighting; (3) protective window and door bars; and (4) an electronic alarm system. Permits a maximum credit of $175. Provides that the tax credit shall be 100 percent of such expenses for individuals who have attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. Provides that when the basis of property is increased as a result of an expenditure for security devices, the taxpayer must reduce such property's basis by the amount of the allowed credit. Disallows a credit when the property is eligible for the investment credit.</summary>
