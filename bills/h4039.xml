  <summary>9/20/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) Declares that the Southern Pacific Transportation Company has abandoned certain real property situated in Alameda County, California, forming a part of the right-of-way granted by the United States to the Central Pacific Railway Company. Retains all Federal right, title, and interest in such property for management by the Secretary of the Interior as a public recreational trail, and for other recreational purposes compatible with trail use. Exempts specified property embraced within a certain public highway from such Federal interest. Reserves to the United States all oil, coal, or other minerals in such property, including prospecting, mining, and removal rights. Restricts to public highway and related uses under California law that portion of the property embraced within a certain public highway. States that all rights and interests revert back to the United States if: (1) any portion of such property is used for purposes unauthorized by this Act; or (2) if an attempt is made to transfer ownership of such property to any party other than the State of California. Mandates that lands within the Toiyabe National Forest (California) which have been used for purposes of the U.S. Marine Corps Mountain Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center be retained as part of such National Forest. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to make such lands available to the Marine Corps for such training center. Directs that such lands be open to public recreation and other uses consistent with the primary purpose of the Mountain Warfare Training Center.</summary>
