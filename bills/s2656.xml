  <summary>7/26/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Uniform Time Act of 1966 to authorize a State in the Pacific or Mountain time zone to establish year-round daylight savings time if such State has: (1) determined that attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide is not likely for at least one nonattainment area in the State; (2) determined that year-round daylight savings time is a necessary part of its efforts to attain such standard; and (3) included in its carbon monoxide standard implementation plan its intention to adopt year-round daylight savings time and information demonstrating that doing so may reduce carbon monoxide levels in a nonattainment area in such State.</summary>
