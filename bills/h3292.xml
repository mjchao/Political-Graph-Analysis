Sets forth requirements relating to the geographic distribution of grants. Provides for allocation of amounts appropriated under provisions of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to carry out demonstration projects for reducing or preventing the incidence in infants of infections with the etiologic agent for AIDS and for providing support to infants who have such infections.
