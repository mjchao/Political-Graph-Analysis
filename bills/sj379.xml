  <summary>9/15/1988--Introduced.
Declares that it shall be U.S. policy to promote the rights of indigenous Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages, including the right to use such languages as the media of instruction in State and Federal educational institutions and as the official language in their traditional territories. Recommends that all institutions of elementary, secondary, and higher education include indigenous languages in their curricula and that competency in such languages be granted the same full academic credit as a foreign language.</summary>
