  <summary>4/19/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended) National Trails System Improvements Act of 1988 - Amends the National Trails System Act to retain to the United States interests in abandoned railroad rights-of-way. Provides for the management of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to release and quitclaim to a unit of State or local government or other entity, for public recreational purposes, all rights and interests in the surface estate of any portion of such rights-of-way not located within a conservation system unit or national forest. Outlines application procedures for such unit or entity to obtain such release, and requires the Secretary to publish in an appropriate newspaper a notice concerning such application. Outlines conditions to be included by the Secretary in such land release, including: (1) a reversion to the United States if such land is attempted to be sold or used for purposes incompatible with public recreation; (2) a disclaimer of legal liability of the United States in connection with such released lands; and (3) a disclaimer of the United States of the duty to inspect such land or to be liable for any unsafe condition with respect to such land. Authorizes the Secretary to sell such lands which are not within or adjacent to public lands after offering the State or local government an opportunity to obtain such lands. Requires sale proceeds to be deposited into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the total proceeds from such sales during the preceding fiscal year. Requires such report to be included in the President's annual budget submitted to the Congress.</summary>
