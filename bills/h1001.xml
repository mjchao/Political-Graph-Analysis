  <summary>2/4/1987--Introduced.
Child Care Opportunities for Families Act - Title I: Increasing the Supply of Child Care - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act to increase the amount of appropriations authorized for FY 1987 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for title XX allotments to States. Reserves specified amounts from such title XX funds for FY 1988 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for use only for the provision of qualified child day care services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allot such reserved funds in the same proportions as regular title XX allotments. Defines qualified child day care services, for such purposes, as child day care services which are provided to: (1) children who are abused or neglected children, or at risk of being abused or neglected, or in families receiving child protective services; (2) children of eligible families who are recipients of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC); and (3) children (handicapped or nonhandicapped) of low-income parents (including legal guardians or primary caretakers) who are adolescents, or working, or enrolled in education or training programs, or seeking employment. Provides that such child day care services funds shall be: (1) only supplementary to funds from other sources (including other title XX funds); (2) separately accounted for in reports and audits; and (3) not transferable for purposes of other Federal block grant programs. Requires States, as a condition of eligibility for title XX block grants, to provide a State share of the total expenditures made by the State during any fiscal year (in cash or kind) for the provision of services directed at the goals set forth under title XX. Sets such State share to be provided from non-Federal public or private sources, at 25 percent of such total expenditures. Establishes a school-based early childhood education and child care services pilot program. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to States to assist local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish and expand such education and services for children aged four and five. Permits such pilot program funds to be used to: (1) extend half-day kindergarten to a full school day or typical working day to meet the needs of working parents; (2) contract with community-based child care organizations to provide part-day child day care to complement existing half-day or full school day school-based kindergarten or early childhood education programs; and (3) establish, or contract with community-based child care organizations to provide, pre-kindergarten or early childhood education programs and child day care services for children four years of age for a typical working day. Sets forth provisions for State applications for such pilot program grants, including requirements for: (1) State and LEA advisory panels; (2) encouragement of participation of severely handicapped children; and (3) priority consideration to programs serving substantial proportions of children from low-income families. Directs the Secretary of Education, in considering such applications to: (1) give preference to applicants whose programs provide services for the typical working day; and (2) ensure an equitable distribution of grants among States. Sets forth requirements for such pilot programs, including parent involvement, sliding scale fee scales, and no fees charged to families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. Sets forth matching requirements for such pilot programs. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent in the first year of assistance, 60 percent in the second year, and 40 percent in the third and any subsequent year. Limits administrative costs to five percent of the grant to the State or five percent of assistance to any LEA. Requires that at least ten percent of the total enrollment opportunities in each LEA in such pilot programs shall be available for handicapped children, with services to meet their special needs. Sets forth requirements for reports on, and evaluation of, such pilot programs. Defines community-based child care organization, for purposes of such pilot program provisions, as a private organization which is representative of the community and which has experience in providing child care services to low-income families. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for the pilot program of school-based early childhood education and child care services. Title II: Upgrading State Child Care Standards - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act to add a further increase (above that already provided under title I of this Act) in the amount of appropriations authorized for FY 1988 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for title XX allotments to States. Reserves specified amounts from such title XX funds for FY 1988 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for incentive grants to States for improvements in their child care licensing, regulatory, and monitoring systems. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to initially allot such reserved funds in the same proportions as regular title XX allotments. Requires that any remaining part of such reserved funds be used for making further grants to States which require additional assistance to carry out their State plans for such purpose. Requires that, for years after FY 1988, priority be given in distributing such additional funds to those States which have developed plans that will lead to their meeting or exceeding the recommended standards established by the National Advisory Committee on Child Care Standards pursuant to this Act. Requires the Governor of each State, as a condition of the State's eligibility for receiving title XX Federal payments, to establish or designate a State Advisory Committee on Child Care Standards which shall: (1) examine, investigate, and study the State's laws, regulations, and procedures for licensing, regulating, and monitoring child care services and programs within the State; and (2) prepare a report outlining the committee's findings and recommendations, including a description of the current status of child care licensing, regulating, or monitoring within the State to be submitted to each State's Governor for transmittal, along with the Governor's comments, to the Secretary of HHS. Establishes a National Advisory Committee on Child Care Standards in order to assist and provide guidance to the States in improving the quality of child care services. Requires each State Advisory Committee and the National Advisory Committee to review the options for child care standards published by the Department of HHS in January 1985 and the final 1980 HEW Day Care Regulations. Directs the National Advisory Committee to issue recommended standards for child care programs, after first publishing proposed standards and receiving comments. Terminates the National Advisory Committee 90 days after the publication of the final recommended standards. Directs the Secretary of HHS, from the title XX funds reserved and allotted to the States for such purpose, to make incentive grants to assist States in carrying out their plans to correct deficiencies in, or otherwise improving, the licensing, regulating, and monitoring of their child care programs. Requires that State applications for such grants include such plans. Requires a detailed explanation if the State plan omits carrying out any recommendation contained in the State advisory committee's report. Title III: Expanding Private Sector Initiatives - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a demonstration program of grants to local private nonprofit organizations to improve and expand child care services in the community by establishing and administering community funds for child care, in partnership with private for-profit businesses. Requires that such grants be used to provide: (1) child care scholarships on a sliding fee scale for low-income families through vouchers or by purchasing slots in child care programs; (2) partial scholarships of such sort to families ineligible for child care under title XX of the Social Security Act and whose income does not exceed $30,000; and (3) loans and grants to local nonprofit organizations (especially those serving significant proportions of low-income children) for start-up or renovation costs for community child day care services. Sets the maximum Federal share of the cost of expenditures from such community funds at 50 percent in the first year of Federal assistance, 40 percent in the second year, and 25 percent in the third and any subsequent year. Sets forth grant application requirements, including: (1) establishment of local advisory boards; and (2) obtaining of at least half of the local share of such community funds from for-profit private businesses. Directs the Secretary of HHS, in considering such applications, to: (1) ensure an equitable distribution of assistance among States and among urban and rural areas; and (2) give preference to organizations that have received such assistance in the previous year. Sets forth requirements for annual reports, evaluations, and audits of such community child care funds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for such community child care funds program. Title IV: Training Child Care Personnel - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act to add a further increase (above that already provided under titles I and II of this Act) in the amount of appropriations authorized for FY 1988 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for title XX allotments to States. Reserves specified amounts from such title XX funds for FY 1988 through 1990 and succeeding fiscal years for use by States in providing child care personnel training and retraining (including training in child development and in prevention of child abuse in day care settings). Provides that such training may be given to: (1) providers of licensed or registered child care services; (2) operators and staffs of facilities where such services are provided; (3) State licensing and enforcement officials; and (4) parents. Gives priority in such training to infant care providers, family day care providers, and providers of care for children with handicapping conditions. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to initially allot such reserved funds in the same proportions as regular title XX allotments. Requires that any remaining part of such reserved funds be used for making further payments to States on the basis of their respective needs and other factors which the Secretary of HHS considers appropriate. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to revise provisions for grants to States for planning and development of dependent care programs. Adds an authorization of appropriations for FY 1988 for allotments to States to carry out the family day care training and technical assistance grants program added by this Act. Prohibits a project under such program from duplicating any services already provided by the State or locality to be served. Permits such program funds for FY 1988 to be used for grants to eligible nonprofit community-based organizations to provide: (1) training to family day care providers and individuals involved in training such providers (including child development and infant care training); and (2) technical assistance to family day care sponsors, providers, and individuals involved in training such providers, on laws and regulations applicable to the provision of family day care services. Allows training and technical assistance relating to the provision of family day care for handicapped children to be included under such grants. Makes nonprofit community-based organizations eligible for such grants if they: (1) have experience with working with such providers; and (2) agree to give training and technical assistance to such providers serving low-income families. Defines family day care as the care of children provided outside their residences, for a fee and on a part-day basis, by an individual in that individual's residence. Title V: Child Care Services for Special Groups - Part C (sic): Comprehensive Service Centers - Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a program of grants to State and local health departments and nonprofit agencies to establish and operate school-located comprehensive health service centers. Requires such programs to be administered through the health resources and services administration of the Department of HHS. Requires such centers to provide, or arrange for the provision of, comprehensive health care services, child care sufficient to enable a student to continue education or enter employment, family life and parenting education, and academic and employment counseling and placement. Makes such services available to any student, but requires that priority attention be given the needs of any student who is an adolescent parent, pregnant, or a potential dropout. Requires such programs to provide or arrange provision of: (1) such services on school campuses to the extent practicable; and (2) transportation of students to and from agencies supplying such services, and of eligible adolescent parents and their children to and from child care services. Sets forth provisions for fee schedules for such services. Prohibits discrimination on the basis of inability to provide full payment for such services. Requires grant recipients to collect reimbursement, where possible, for the Medicaid and title XX child care services programs under the Social Security Act. Limits State or local administrative costs to ten percent, and Federal administrative costs to one percent, of program funds. Sets forth grant application requirements. Directs the Secretary of HHS, in reviewing such applications, to: (1) consider the equitable geographic distribution of grants among States, and among urban and rural areas; and (2) give preference to recipients who will provide services in schools with the highest adolescent birth rate and the highest concentrations of low-income students and potential dropouts. Requires that Federal funds for such programs be supplementary to State and local funds, and that such programs provide services which are in addition to, rather than in substitution for, comparable services previously provided without Federal assistance. Sets the maximum Federal share of assistance to a center at 100 percent in the first year, 75 percent in the second year, and 50 percent in the third and any subsequent year of assistance. Sets forth annual reporting requirements for grant recipients. Directs the Secretary of HHS, after the second year of such assistance, to provide for an independent evaluation of a representative sample of such programs. Defines comprehensive health care services to include: (1) primary and preventive health services, including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care; (2) pregnancy testing and maternity counseling; (3) nutrition counseling and referral; (4) screening and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases; (5) appropriate pediatric care; (6) pediatric services for infants born to adolescents; (7) mental health services and referral; (8) family planning services; (9) dental services and referral; and (10) such other services as the Secretary of HHS provides by regulation. Defines child care services,for purposes of this part, as services that: (1) are provided by a school-based or community-based child care organization; (2) at a minimum include the provision of child care services to any child of an adolescent parent from birth through age 30 months; and (3) meet applicable State licensing standards. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for the grants program for school-located comprehensive health service centers under this part. Part D: Child Care Expenses for AFDC Recipients - Amends Social Security Act provisions relating to aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) to allow an increased amount of child care expenses to be taken into consideration in determinations of AFDC eligibility.</summary>
