  <summary>10/1/1988--Indefinitely postponed in Senate.
(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 2266 passed in lieu) Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 - Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 (including grants-in-aid authorizations). Sets a maximum allocation of 20 percent for pipeline safety grant indirect expenses. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to make certain unexpended funds available to States which: (1) undertake new responsibilities relating to State pipeline safety certification programs; or (2) implement a one-call damage prevention program established under State law. Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act to authorize the Secretary to certify and require testing of individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards requiring pipeline facility operators to provide certain information to the Secretary or appropriate requesting State official, including: (1) the operator's business name, address, and telephone numbers; (2) maps showing the location of major pipeline facilities, including transmission and major distribution lines; (3) a description of the characteristics of the operator's pipelines within the State; (4) a description of all products transported through such pipelines in the State; (5) any other information the Secretary considers useful and necessary to inform the States of pipeline facilities and operations within their boundaries; (6) an emergency response plan; and (7) a State pipeline facilities operation and maintenance manual. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish minimum Federal standards to require, within one year after enactment of this Act, pipeline facility operators to complete and maintain an inventory of all types of pipe used to transmit gas in the operator's system, together with other specified information. Directs the Secretary by regulation to establish qualifications for States to meet for the pipeline safety grant program, including qualifications for State employees who perform inspections pursuant to either an annual certification by a State agency or an agreement relating to inspection between the State agency and the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to add at least two more pipeline safety instructors at the Transportation Safety Institute. Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to promote more effective coordination between Federal and State pipeline regulatory agencies regarding pipeline accident responses. Increases the civil penalty for pipeline safety violations from $1,000 to $10,000. Establishes criminal penalties (fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both) for the willful and knowing defacement, damage, removal, or destruction of any pipeline sign or right-of-way marker required by Federal law or regulation. Directs the Secretary to biennially inspect and require the testing of pipeline facilities to ensure their safety. Directs the Secretary to assess the feasibility of regulating persons whose excavation activities may result in pipeline damage and to report the results of such assessment to the Congress. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to establish minimum Federal guidelines for one-call telecommunications systems to alert natural gas pipeline operators to construction and other specified activities in the vicinity of pipeline facilities. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of requiring the inspection of transmission facilities with instrumented internal inspection devices. Requires a report of such study to the Congress within 18 months after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility, safety, cost, and effectiveness of requiring pipeline facility operators to install emergency flow restricting devices in existing and future pipeline systems. Requires a report to the Congress on such study within one year after enactment of this Act. Amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to permit a written power of attorney for mileage disclosure statements. Defines the term "transferor." Mandates that State motor vehicle registration procedures include annually updated odometer information, which must be retained for a five year period. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations designed to prevent odometer fraud. States that certain Federal odometer fraud regulations shall apply to the States 24 months after enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to complete a rulemaking within 12 months after enactment of this Act in order to implement its odometer fraud provisions. Declares that a specific recodification of Federal transportation law does not substantively affect existing rights, liabilities, or remedies under Federal law regarding oil pipelines.</summary>
