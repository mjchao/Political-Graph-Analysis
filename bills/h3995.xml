  <summary>2/24/1988--Introduced.
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) to revise attainment dates for areas which failed to attain the national ambient air quality standard for ozone or carbon monoxide by 1988. Requires States with revised attainment dates to conduct an inventory of emissions of each of the air pollutants which contributed to its failure to attain the air quality standard and submit, for the Administrator's approval, a revision of the State implementation plan for each area which failed to attain such standard for ozone or carbon monoxide by 1988. Requires that each implementation plan revision contain a schedule and enforceable measures to ensure that the standard is met before the revised attainment date. Credits States which establish such schedules with emissions inventory reductions which are projected to be achieved through certain existing and proposed air pollution control measures. Prohibits new or modified major stationary sources of air pollutants from receiving an operating permit unless increased emissions from such sources of the pollutants which are subject to this Act are offset by a greater reduction of such emissions from existing units in the area. Requires the size of such reduction to reflect the extent to which the area exceeds the air quality standard for the pollutant. Requires that the revised implementation plan for an area which requires more than ten years to meet standards for ozone and carbon monoxide include: (1) long-term urban planning measures to reduce emissions of the applicable air pollutants; and (2) a schedule for increasing in annual increments the percentage of new motor vehicles registered in the area which are low emission vehicles. Directs the Administrator to modify the revised attainment dates for areas which fail to attain the air quality standard for ozone or carbon monoxide by such revised date. Requires States, as before, to conduct an inventory of the air pollutants which contributed to such failure and submit, for the Administrator's approval, a revision of the State implementation plan for offending areas. Authorizes the Administrator to impose greater emission reduction requirements on existing units, as part of the new stationary unit permit process, and sewer hook-up fees on new facilities in offending areas if the revision of the State implementation plan for such area is not implemented. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study of the extent to which the interstate transport of air pollutants contributes to concentrations of ozone or carbon monoxide in nonattainment areas. Authorizes the Administrator to require any State to revise the implementation plan for an area which contributes significantly to concentrations of ozone or carbon monoxide in any nonattainment area in another State. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress within three years of this Act's enactment on a study monitoring the formation of ozone and quantifying populations exposed to ozone concentrations which exceed the air quality standard. Requires the manufacturer of each new motor vehicle or engine to warrant to the purchaser that such vehicle or engine is: (1) equipped with emission control components enabling it to conform with emission control regulations at the time of sale; and (2) free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause it to fail to conform with such regulations during the first two years or 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Eliminates certain restrictions on the maintenance, replacement, and repair of emission control components. Prohibits States from establishing or enforcing a warranty or prescribed maintenance requirement for new motor vehicles on engines which is not identical to the corresponding Federal warranty or prescribed maintenance requirements. Permits individuals engaged in the automotive business to remove emission control components provided such removal is necessary for routine maintenance of the vehicle. Gives the owner of any motor vehicle or engine the responsibility of replacing and maintaining emission control devices at any facility of his or her choosing, unless such device is covered by a warranty not required by the Clean Air Act. Authorizes manufacturers to condition their emission control warranties on a purchaser's use of parts or services provided without charge pursuant to the purchase agreement.</summary>
