(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 4833 passed in lieu) Nurse Education Reauthorization Act of 1988 - Title I: Special Projects - Amends title VIII (Nurse Education) of the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants and enter into contracts for special projects to: (1) increase nursing opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing faculty development directed at facilitating retention of such individuals; (2) provide training and education to upgrade skills of paraprofessional nursing personnel with priority given to rapid transition programs towards undergraduate degrees; and (3) provide training and education to develop curricula for baccalaureate and masters degrees in nursing. Authorizes appropriations for grants and contracts for various special projects for FY 1989 through 1991. Directs the Secretary, in making grants and contracts relating to advanced nurse education, to give priority to programs with innovative curricula that permit individuals to rapidly achieve advanced degrees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Requires programs for the education of nurse practitioners and nurse midwives to have an enrollment of not less than six full-time equivalent students. (Current law requires not less than eight students.) Allows those receiving traineeships to fulfill their commitment to practice as a nurse practitioner or nurse midwife in the Indian Health Service, a Native Hawaiian health center, a long-term care facility certified under title XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, a migrant health center, or a community health center. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Directs the Secretary to make grants to or enter into contracts with schools of nursing for projects to demonstrate and evaluate innovative nursing practice models designed to increase the recruitment and retention of nurses to provide long-term, home, or nursing home care. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Directs the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts to develop, establish, and operate from one to five regional model professional nurse recruitment centers, including centers in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Title II: Assistance to Nursing Students - Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts to cover the cost of traineeships to cover the costs of tuition, fees, and other direct educational costs for nurses pursuing graduate degrees in other disciplines. Conditions the traineeship on the recipient agreeing to provide full-time service, with or without compensation, for one month for each month covered by the traineeship in a health manpower shortage area, a long-term care facility certified under title XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, a community health center, a migrant health center, the Indian Health Service, a Native Hawaiian health center, or a public health care facility. Requires repayment if the recipient does not complete training or does not complete the service obligation. Authorizes appropriations for traineeships for advanced education of professional nurses for FY 1989 through 1991. Amends provisions authorizing the Secretary to make grants for programs for the education of nurse anesthetists to allow the funds to be used to plan, develop, and operate as well as to improve such programs. Authorizes appropriations for traineeships for nurse anesthetists for FY 1989 through 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to schools of nursing for scholarships to full time undergraduate students in financial need, the amount of the scholarship not to exceed tuition and fees, with priority given to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Prohibits provisions relating to collection, by schools of nursing, of student loans from being construed to require such schools to reimburse the student loan program for loans that became uncollectable prior to 1983. Requires that students receiving loans from schools of nursing under specified provisions be in need. (Current law requires them to be of exceptional financial need.) Delays until the last calendar quarter of 1994 the period during which there must be a capital distribution of the balance of the nursing school student loan fund established under specified provisions. Authorizes the Secretary to award scholarships and loans to full-time students in nursing schools who have contracted with a health care facility to engage in full-time employment as a nurse for a period at least equal to the period during which the student received the scholarship and loan assistance. Prohibits the assistance from exceeding the cost of tuition, reasonable living expenses, books, fees, and necessary transportation. Conditions eligibility on demonstration of financial need. Mandates that preference be given to disadvantaged and minority students underrepresented in the nursing profession. Limits the loan portion of a scholarship and loan award to 75 percent of the award. Limits interest to five percent. Allows the health care facility holding such a contract with a student to contract with the Secretary to repay up to 75 percent of the student's loan. Provides for the liability of the student and the facility if the contract between them is not fulfilled. Requires at least 35 percent of the amount made available for a fiscal year to be allotted for students who contract with facilities in rural or frontier areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1991. Title III: General - Renames the National Advisory Council on Nurse Training as the Advisory Council on Nurses Education.</summary>
