  <summary>3/31/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to establish procedures for the imposition of the death penalty. Requires a separate hearing after a defendant is convicted of an offense for which death is a possible penalty. Sets forth requirements for notice to the defendant, the identity of the judge and the composition of the jury, and the presentation of evidence. Prohibits a jury from recommending a death penalty unless it finds: (1) that at least one of a specified number of aggravating circumstances exists; and (2) that any such aggravating circumstance, together with all the evidence, outweighs any of a specified number of mitigating circumstances. Authorizes a judge to impose a death sentence upon a jury's recommendation, or in the absence of a jury, upon the judge's own determination according the considerations under this Act. Specifies circumstances in which a judge shall impose a penalty other than a death sentence. Provides for appeal and judicial review of a death sentence. Prohibits the execution of a death sentence on a pregnant woman. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide for the imposition of the death penalty for certain continuing criminal enterprise activities which result in death.</summary>
