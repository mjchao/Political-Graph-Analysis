  <summary>4/7/1987--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Energy to implement radioactive waste disposal activities (involving first and second repositories and the monitored retrievable storage facility) in accordance with the mission plan for the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program (including a proposed amendment to such plan dated January 1987). Authorizes the Secretary to delay site-specific activities for a second repository beyond the recommendations of such mission plan if the Secretary submits the reasons for such delay to the Congress. Declares that in the event of any inconsistent provision between the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the mission plan, the provision of the mission plan and its amendment is controlling.</summary>
