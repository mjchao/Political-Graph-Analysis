  <summary>8/6/1987--Introduced.
Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to provide medical services to a veteran (and, if necessary, to a veteran's spouse) to the extent necessary to overcome the effects of a service-connected disability of the veteran which impairs or prevents the ability of the veteran and his or her spouse to conceive a child. Excludes certain procedures and services from those permitted as part of such medical services provided (such as artificial insemination and the use of surrogate mothers).</summary>
