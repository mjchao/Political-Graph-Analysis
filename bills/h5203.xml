  <summary>10/3/1988--Reported to House amended.
(Reported to House from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, amended, H. Rept. 100-1033 (Pt. I)) Expands the Quinault Indian Reservation to include specified lands within the Olympic National Forest, to be held in trust by the United States for the Quinault Nation. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to manage certain lands within such Forest and distribute the proceeds from the sale of forest products on such lands. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from approving the sale for export of unprocessed timber from such lands, unless such timber is surplus to domestic needs. Directs the Secretary to: (1) limit the sale of timber from such lands to a quantity equal to or less than an amount which can be removed from such lands annually in perpetuity on a long term sustained-yield basis, with exceptions; and (2) administer all timber and forest products sold from such lands in accordance with the conditions of the policy statement for the Grays Harbor Sustained Yield Unit as long as such policy statement remains in effect. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) reserve permanent easements (including provisions for cooperative maintenance) for the purpose of continuing access, including public access, to National Forest System (NFS) lands on specified roads; and (2) allow such rights-of-way through NFS lands as the Secretary of the Interior considers necessary to provide access to Reservation lands. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to allow similar access to, and management of, NFS lands to the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to maintain a separate account for timber receipts from the lands. Provides that these funds can be used by the Quinault Nation only for paying costs incurred in preparing and administering timber sales (including road construction and maintenance), mitigating adverse environmental impacts from timber harvest activities, reforestation of timber lands, and purchasing land that is within Reservation boundaries.</summary>
