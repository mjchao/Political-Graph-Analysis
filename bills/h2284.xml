  <summary>5/5/1987--Introduced.
Interim Great Lakes Economic Protection Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of State to initiate discussions and reach an agreement with Canada regarding an emergency plan of action for the prompt implementation of all existing control measures which will lower the water levels of the Great Lakes. Requires the Secretary of the Army, upon notification of such an agreement, to: (1) increase the rate of diversion of water from Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, whenever the water level exceeds a specified elevation on a monthly average; (2) maximize the rate of flow of water through the Black Rock Lock; and (3) implement such other measures as are established by the agreement to protect shoreline interests along the Great Lakes from injury resulting from high lake levels. Declares that an increase in the rate of diversion of water from Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois shall: (1) shall not be included in the State of Illinois' accounting of water diversion from the Lake under any decree of the Supreme Court; (2) be implemented by Illinois and the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago under the direct control and supervision of the Secretary of the Army; and (3) be controlled and stopped or reduced, as directed by the Secretary, whenever bankful conditions at certain flood warning stations are predicted, and as necessary to maintain safe navigation conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a monitoring program to assess the impact of such lake level control measures.</summary>
