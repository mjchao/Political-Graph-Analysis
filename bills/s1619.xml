  <summary>10/5/1988--Reported to Senate amended.
(Reported to Senate from the Committee on the Judiciary with amendment (without written report)) Visual Artists Rights Act of 1988 - Amends the copyright law to define a "work of visual art" and a "work of recognized stature." Grants the author of a work of visual art the right to claim authorship of such work when publicly displayed, independent of his or her copyright, and to disclaim such authorship of such work because of substantial distortion or alteration that harms the reputation of such author. Grants the author who is not a copyright owner the exclusive right during his or her lifetime to assert copyright infringement if a publicly displayed work of visual art (or a work of recognized stature) has been altered or multilated by an intentional act or gross negligence. Waives artists' rights when a work cannot be removed from a building without distortion, mutilation, or alteration, unless such rights are expressly reserved by an instrument in writing. Directs the Register of Copyrights to establish a recordation system for authors of works of recognized stature that have been incorporated into a building. Stipulates when a claim accrues for purposes of an action for copyright infringement of an author of a work of visual art. Directs the Register of Copyrights and the Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts to report to the Congress the results of a jointly conducted feasibility study regarding new initiatives enabling authors of works of visual art to participate in the commercial exploitation of their work after its first sale. Requires submission of such report within 12 months after enactment of this Act.</summary>
