  <summary>1/27/1987--Introduced.
Congressional Foreign Travel Accountability Act of 1987 - Prohibits the use of Federal funds for the expenses of foreign travel by Members of Congress or congressional officers or employees unless such expenses are paid out of a specific appropriation included in the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act or any supplement thereto. Requires such travel to be: (1) accomplished by the most economical means possible; (2) approved in advance by the committee involved; and (3) accomplished by United States commercial carriers, unless an alternative means is more economical. Requires congressional committees to establish guidelines to avoid duplicative and unnecessary travel and to file quarterly reports on such travel for public inspection. Sets forth civil penalties for persons who use such reports for unlawful, commercial, or solicitation purposes.</summary>
