  <summary>5/17/1988--Introduced.
Maritime Drug Law Enforcement and Enhancement Act of 1988 - Title I: Drug Enforcement Budget Improvements - Requires the President to include with each budget submitted to the Congress a report of amounts spent and proposed to be spent for illegal drug enforcement programs. Requires each congressional committee to issue annual reports estimating the total budget authority required by each agency for effective illegal drug enforcement programs within each committee's jurisdiction. Title II: Coast Guard Drug Interdicition Enhancement - Adds maritime air surveillance and interdiction as a primary duty of the Coast Guard. Sets forth the law enforcement powers of the Coast Guard officers, including arrests, searches, and seizures. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Commissioner of Customs to allow the Coast Guard access to the Customs Forfeiture Fund assets for payment of seizure, informer, and other expenses. Permits the use of Fund monies for: (1) expenses of bringing seized vessels into compliance with environmental laws before disposing of them by sinking; and (2) equipping vessels, vehicles, and aircraft for official use. Extends indemnification protection to Naval officers and personnel acting under orders aboard Navy vessels on which Coast Guard law enforcement detachments are assigned from penalties or damages when such vessels fire on another vessel that fails to stop following an order to do so. Authorizes the Commandant of the Coast Guard to indemnify Coast Guard members against personal liability for actions taken within the scope of their official law enforcement duties. Authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for foot patrol boats, helicopters, and radars and operation, maintenance, and personnel for such equipment. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to submit to the Congress a draft of legislation to restrict vessels and aircraft with cargoes from, or shipped through, countries certified by the Secretary of State to be drug-producing countries; and (2) subject such vessels and aircraft to quarantine, inspection, and the assessment of fees. Title III: Great Lakes Drug Interdiction - Directs the Secretary of Transportation and the Commissioner of Customs to enter into an agreement to increase the effectiveness of maritime drug interdiction activities in the Great Lakes area. Provides for increased use of long-range surveillance aircraft to detect drug smuggling in such area. Directs the Secretary of State to negotiate with Canada to reach an agreement providing for increased cooperation and information sharing with respect to illegal drug interdiction efforts conducted along the U.S.-Canadian border. Title IV: Vessel Identification - Defines "United States vessel" and "documented vessel." Amends Federal provisions regarding vessel agent identification and recreational vessel titling. Provides for grants to States for use in establishing or upgrading State recreational vessel uniform title programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 for such grants. Title V: Reorganization to Coordinate Maritime Law Enforcement - Federal Maritime Administration Act - Replaces provisions of chapter 1 (Organization) of title 49 (Transportation) of the U.S. Code relating to the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation with a provision establishing the Federal Maritime Administration (Administration) in the Department of Transportation. States that the Administration shall consist of the Coast Guard and the National Maritime Service and be headed by the Under Secretary for Maritime Affairs and Readiness. Redesignates the Maritime Administration transferred to the Department of Transportation by the Maritime Act of 1981 as the National Maritime Service. Transfers to the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administration, certain functions of: (1) the National Ocean Service in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce; and (2) the National Weather Service of the Department of Commerce. Redesignates the Commissioned Officer Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as the Commissioned Officer Corps of the Administration. Provides for related transfers and terminations. Sets forth savings and transition provisions. Establishes the Merchant Marine Reserve within the Coast Guard, to consist of members of the Coast Guard Reserve with special knowledge or expertise regarding merchant marine affairs. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to report to the Congress with recommended methods to consolidate in a single functional category for purposes of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 all budget authority relating to the Administration, including the military programs conducted by the Coast Guard.</summary>
