  <summary>3/26/1987--Introduced.
Amends the National Labor Relations Act to provide that in the construction industry a collective bargaining agreement may not be repudiated unless the National Labor Relations Board certifies election results in which a majority of the employees in a bargaining unit select a bargaining representive other than the representative with whom the agreement was made, or choose not to be represented by a labor organization. States that upon expiration of such agreement, the employer and the labor organization shall be under no obligation to bargain collectively unless the majority status of the labor organization has been established by election. Requires the National Labor Relations Board to prescribe procedures for the conduct of such elections.</summary>
