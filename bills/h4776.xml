Nation's Capital Religious Liberty and Academic Freedom Act - Prohibits any funds appropriated by this Act from being obligated or expended after December 31, 1988, unless the District of Columbia adopts specified language amending the District of Columbia Code to provide that, notwithstanding any other provision of District of Columbia law, it is not an unlawful discriminatory practice for any educational institution that is affiliated with or closely associated with the tenets of a religious organization to deny funds or facilities to any person or persons that are organized for, or engaged in, promoting, encouraging, or condoning any homosexual act, lifestyle, orientation, or belief.
