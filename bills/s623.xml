  <summary>4/12/1988--Passed House amended.
(Measure passed House, amended, in lieu of H.R. 11) Independent Safety Board Act Amendments of 1988 - Amends the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Authorizes appropriations for the establishment of an emergency fund for use by the National Transportation Safety Board (the Board) for accident investigations. Repeals the requirement that the National Transportation Safety Board publish notice of the issuance and availability of its accident reports in the Federal Register. Authorizes the Board to utilize at any time on a reimbursable basis the services of the Transportation Safety Institute (Department of Transportation). Directs the Secretary of Transportation to continue to make the Institute available: (1) to the Board for safety training of Board employees; and (2) to such safety personnel of other organizations as the Board may from time to time designate. Directs the Board to establish periodically a reasonable fee for the training of designated non-Federal safety personnel. Requires such fee to be offset against any annual reimbursement agreement between the Board and the Secretary with respect to training costs. Authorizes the Board to require payment from governmental entities for the reasonable cost of goods and services supplied, and to apply the funds received to the Board's appropriations.</summary>
