  <summary>4/22/1987--Introduced.
Rural Nursing Care Access Amendments of 1987 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to permit certain rural hospitals having less than 150 beds to provide Medicare extended care services. (Currently, such hospitals must have less than 50 beds.) Provides that, as an alternative to procuring a State certificate of need for extended care services, such hospitals may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that: (1) there is no Medicare skilled nursing facility in the county (or equivalent area) in which the hospital is located or; (2) if there are such facilities, at least 95 percent of facility beds have been occupied during the year preceding the hospital's annual agreement with the Secretary for the provision of such services. Reimburses eligible hospitals for routine extended care services on the same basis on which skilled nursing facilities in the area are reimbursed for such services.</summary>
