  <summary>3/23/1987--Introduced.
National Energy Security Act of 1987 - Delineates the conditions under which a fee will be imposed upon the first sale of an imported petroleum product within the United States. States that under this Act no fee will be imposed for the sale of any petroleum product for export or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. Declares such import fee deductible for income tax purposes. Requires such fee to be treated like the windfall profit tax. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Trust Fund. Appropriates to such Fund one-half the fees received under this Act for imported crude oil and refined petroleum products. Limits expenditures from such Fund to implementation of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. Precludes the receipts and disbursements from such Fund from inclusion in the budget totals submitted by either the President or the Congress, and exempts such Fund from any general statutory budget limitation.</summary>
