  <summary>6/20/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) lower from $10,000,000,000 to $20,000,000 the extramural research and development budget threshold that determines which agencies must establish a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program; and (2) increase to an absolute maximum of three percent the required percentage of an agency's extramural research and development budget funds devoted to its SBIR program. Makes the SBIR program permanent by repealing a provision of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 that terminates authority for the program on October 1, 1993.</summary>
