  <summary>5/6/1987--Introduced.
Nuclear Energy Waste Policy Act of 1987 - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prohibit any spent nuclear fuel from being transported to a high-level nuclear waste repository until that fuel has been stored for a minimum of 50 years from the time of its removal from the reactor's core. Specifies that storage must take place: (1) on the grounds of the commercial nuclear powerplant which generated the spent fuel; (2) on the grounds of a commercial nuclear powerplant to which spent fuel has been transshipped; or (3) at a monitored retrievable storage facility licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</summary>
