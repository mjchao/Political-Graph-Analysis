Amends rule XI to require any Member of the Committee on Rules who would call up as a question of privilege any rule, joint rule, or order of business resolution which has not been called up for consideration within seven legislative days after being reported, to notify the House of such intention on the calendar day before calling it up. Provides for funding all standing and certain select committee expenses for the first three months of either the first or the second session of a Congress (currently, only the first session is so provided for). Amends rule XIV to allow House Members, during debate, to refer to actions taken by the Senate which are a matter of public record and to the pendency or sponsorship of Senate bills, resolutions, and amendments. Prohibits references to individual Senators, expressions of opinions concerning Senate action, or quotations from Senate proceedings. Amends rule XLIII to increase from $35 or less to $50 or less the fair market value of a gift which may be accepted by a Member, officer, or employee from persons having a direct interest in legislation before the Congress or from foreign nationals.
