Provides that a certified Program participant shall not be eligible to participate in the Program for more than eight years. Sets forth eligibility and certification requirements, including ownership and personal net worth tests to determine whether a small business concern is socially and economically disadvantaged. Mandates that each Program participant annually certify its continuing eligibility. States that a Program participant shall be graduated: (1) upon successful completion of the Program; (2) upon exceeding the applicable size standard established by the Small Business Administration (SBA); (3) if it is no longer owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; or (4) if it elects to graduate prior to the expiration of its Program participation term. Sets forth circumstances under which a participant is terminated from the Program and provisions for challenging a participant's eligibility. Provides a special rule permitting procurement assistance to more than one small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe if certain conditions are met.

Requires annual plan review and modifications as appropriate. Authorizes the SBA Administrator to make available to Program participants financial assistance to help defray the costs incurred in the preparation of offers necessary to compete for the award of Government and commercial contracts. Requires the Program to: (1) establish a training program to be delivered at the regional level to instruct participants in preparing effective proposals to competitive solicitations issued by Federal agencies; and (2) provide assistance to public or private entities to conduct seminars to help participants to develop business plans that will enhance their potential for operating profitably upon graduation. Authorizes the SBA to make loans directly to small business concerns under the Program, or under the minority small business program, for the purchase of equipment, facilities, materials, supplies, or other necessary production or technical assets and for working capital. Sets forth limitations in connection with such assistance. Title IV: Business Development Through Federal Contracting Opportunities - Prohibits the SBA from awarding to a Program participant a contract under the minority small business concern provisions, unless the participant certifies that the aggregate dollar amount of all contracts awarded to it by the SBA does not exceed a specified schedule of its new sales. Directs the Administrator to take measures to assure that not more than 25 percent of a participant's new sales are from noncompetitively awarded contracts in the final year of Program participation. Sets forth the circumstances under which the SBA may award such contracts notwithstanding such schedule. Requires certain Federal agencies to prepare a forecast of expected contracting opportunities or classes of contracting opportunities for the next and succeeding fiscal years considered to be suitable for award to minority small business concerns. Mandates that the forecasts be available to small business concerns. Requires each Program participant annually to forecast its needs for contract awards for the next Program year and the succeeding Program year during the review of its business plan. Requires the SBA to award contracts to the minority business concern recommended by the procuring agency offering the contract opportunity if: (1) the Program participant is determined to be a responsible contractor; (2) the award of contract would be consistent with the participant's business plan; and (3) the award of the contract would not result in the participant's exceeding the requirements of the schedule of new sales. Requires that awards be made to participants selected through a competition restricted to eligible candidates.

Sets forth conditions to govern the competition for awards, as well as administrative provisions and limitations, including protest procedures. Describes conditions under which an agency is authorized to conduct a competition conforming to methods used prior to the effective date of this Act. Requires a small business concern that is awarded a contract under the Program to complete performance of the contract, even if the period of contract performance extends beyond the firm's graduation from the Program. Requires the Government contracting officer to limit contract modifications to those necessary to attain contract performance when the contract is being performed by a contractor who either has been terminated for cause from the Program or is unable to meet Program requirements. Permits the SBA to approve a contract modification within 30 days after a participant's graduation if the modification was recommended for approval by the procuring agency prior to the graduation date. Sets forth the circumstances under which a socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern may transfer a contract to another business concern. Provides for appeals of agency decisions regarding minority small business contract opportunities. Directs the SBA to study and report to the House and Senate Small Business Committees on the geographic distribution of contract awards under the minority small business program, including recommendations for effecting a more equitable distribution of contracting opportunities in States with significant minority business populations. Instructs the SBA to make sustained and substantial efforts to solicit applications for Program certification from concerns in areas of high unemployment or underemployment, in labor surplus areas, and in States having few participants.

Requires a Program participant to report annually to its assigned Business Opportunity Specialist: (1) a listing of parties receiving compensation to assist in obtaining a Federal contract for the participant; and (2) the amount of compensation received by such persons during the relevant reporting period and a description of the activities performed for such compensation. Directs the Administrator to appoint a Task Force on Small Business Development to assess the developmental cycles and financing problems of various industries and recommend solutions. Requires the Task Force to file a written report with the Administrator no later than April 15, 1990, and directs the SBA to make the report available immediately to the House and Senate Small Business Committees. Directs the Administrator to develop and implement a process for the systematic collection of data on the benefits derived by the U.S. economy and by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as a result of the operation of the Program. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the congressional Small Business Committees, beginning on April 30, 1989, on the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program. Prescribes report contents. Revises definitions relating to the minority small business procurement program to include Native Hawaiian community service organizations as Indian tribes.

Requires Federal prime contracts that contain subcontracting goals for small businesses and disadvantaged small businesses to provide for liquidated damages if the prime contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with the goals.

Part C: Amendments to the Small Business Act - Amends the Small Business Act to disregard procurements of $25,000 or less in establishing goals for small business and disadvantaged small business participation.
