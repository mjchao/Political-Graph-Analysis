  <summary>12/2/1987--Introduced.
Recommends that a one-year across the board freeze of all Federal spending and existing Federal tax rates be adopted at the earliest possible date to help restore national and international confidence in the U.S. economy. Urges that such freeze encompass: (1) all appropriated accounts for defense and nondefense discretionary spending with spending maintained at FY 1987 budget authority levels; (2) inflation adjustments for all Federal retirees and other Federal entitlement beneficiaries limited to two percent, except for supplemental security income; and (3) existing Federal tax rates for individuals and corporations. Urges that such a one-year freeze be considered as the minimum acceptable step toward deficit reduction and that asset sales, improved tax compliance, and other deficit reduction measures be seriously considered.</summary>
