  <summary>12/4/1987--Introduced.
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 - Title I: Commerce - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission, prior to the transfer of a construction permit or broadcast station license, to assess and collect from the transferor a charge of two percent of the selling price or of the fair market value, whichever is greater. Increases the charge to three percent if the transfer has violated the Fairness Doctrine. Increases such charge to four percent (five percent if the transfer has violated the Fairness Doctrine) if the Commission finds that the transfer has not operated the station for more than three years, unless: (1) the application involves only an FM translator station or FM booster station; (2) the application involves a pro forma assignment or transfer of control; (3) the transferor has made an affirmative factual showing that because of materially changed circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of the license or permit, a change in ownership will serve the public interest; or (4) the disposal of the permit or license was authorized in accordance with regulations concerning minority ownership of broadcast stations. Prohibits the Commission from waiving or deferring such charge. Provides that moneys received from such charge shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury until September 30, 1989, and thereafter in the Public Broadcasting Trust Fund to be established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Provides that such Fund shall be used solely: (1) by the Secretary of Commerce for the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities; and (2) for the Public Broadcasting Fund to provide financial support for public broadcasting.

Prohibits the Secretary from setting the customary charge for a new physician's services at more than 80 percent of the prevailing charge for a service. Reduces the prevailing charge for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant, intraocular lens insertion, coronary artery bypass surgery, total hip replacement, suprapubic prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, diagnostic dilation and curettage, and carpal tunnel release. Limits nonparticipating physicians' actual charges for such procedures if such reductions in prevailing charges result in reductions in the reasonable charges for such procedures. Makes certain changes in the calculation of maximum allowable actual charges for physicians who did not have actual charges for a procedure in the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 1984, and in the application of such charges to a group practice. Makes the imposition of civil penalties for the improper use of assistants at cataract surgery inapplicable to surgery performed prior to March 1, 1987.

Authorizes the Secretary to establish demonstration projects examining the feasibility of requiring instruction and oversight of rural physicians, in lieu of imposing sanctions, through the use of video communication between rural and teaching hospitals. Permits providers to represent Medicare beneficiaries during appeals of PRO determinations, but prohibits providers from imposing any financial liability on such beneficiaries in connection with such representation. Protects Medicare beneficiaries from liability for services which PROs determine are not covered under the Medicare program. Requires a hospital to notify a patient of its request that a PRO review its determination that such patient no longer requires inpatient hospital care if the attending physician disagrees with the hospital's determination. Subpart V: Provisions Affecting Medicaid - Amends the Medicare and Medicaid programs to impose a common set of requirements on Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid intermediate care facilities (nursing facilities). Includes within such set requirements that nursing facilities: (1) maintain clinical records on all residents and assess, upon the resident's admission and periodically thereafter, the resident's mental, physical, and psychosocial needs, utilizing a minimum data set to be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) not admit any new resident, after 1988, who is mentally ill or retarded unless the State mental health authority deems such individual to require nursing facility services and decides whether the individual requires active treatment for mental illness or retardation; (3) provide 24-hour nursing services, employ at least one full-time registered professional nurse (both staffing requirements are currently imposed on skilled nursing facilities), and employ at least one full-time social worker; (4) provide care without requiring certain assurances regarding the source of payment for such services or discriminating against individuals who are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid; (5) protect specified resident rights and notify residents regarding such rights; (6) transfer or discharge a resident without the resident's consent only when such action is essential to the resident's welfare, the health or safety of others would otherwise be endangered, or the resident fails to pay allowable charges, and only after complying with specified procedures; (7) provide the Secretary, the States, service providers, and resident relatives with specified access and visitation rights; (8) maintain a quality assessment and assurance program which is attuned to the comments and complaints of nursing facility staff and residents; (9) require each of their nursing aides to successfully complete a training and testing program that entails competency-based testing before the assumption of direct resident care and at least 100 hours of initial training; and (10) protect a resident's personal funds. Requires, in addition, that Medicare skilled nursing facilities create or revise a written plan of care for each of their residents after making an assessment of their mental, physical, and psychosocial needs. Requires that, in addition to the preadmission review of mentally ill or retarded individuals, State mental health authorities conduct an annual review of mentally ill or retarded residents to determine whether such residents require nursing facility services and whether they require active treatment for mental illness or retardation. Directs that such preadmission and annual reviews be conducted in accordance with criteria to be developed by the Secretary by October 1, 1988. Sets forth required nursing facility responses to determinations as to whether such residents need nursing facility services and need, or do not need, active treatment for mental illness or retardation. Gives long-term residents who do not require nursing facility services, but who require active treatment, the choice of remaining in the facility or receiving covered services in an alternative setting. Requires nursing facilities to provide for the active treatment of residents in need of treatment for mental illness or retardation regardless of their continued need for nursing facility services or their discharge from such facility.
