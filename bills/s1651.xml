  <summary>8/7/1987--Introduced.
Farm Program Revision Act of 1987 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to set 1987 through 1990 feed grain price support levels at $2.40 per bushel (current 1986 support price is $2.40 per bushel). Limits wheat and feed grain price support reductions to: (1) not less than 20 percent for 1987; and (2) not less than ten percent for 1988 through 1990. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make payments (as provided for in this Act) to specified 1987 feed grain producers. Sets 1988 through 1990 wheat price support levels at $2.85 per bushel. Limits to 25 percent the amount of deficiency payments that may be paid in generic in-kind certificates for the 1987 through 1990 crops of wheat, feed grains, upland and extra long staple cottons, and rice. Raises the limits on the amount of wheat and feed grain allowed in the producer reserve program. Requires that program storage payment rates equal average commercial rates.</summary>
