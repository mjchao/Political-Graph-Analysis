  <summary>9/14/1988--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to convey certain lands in Okaloosa County, Florida, to the State of Florida in exchange for certain real property adjacent to the Eglin Air Force Base, including any land within the tract which may have been created by natural accretion or dumping of dredge spoil. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) ensure that public access for recreational purposes to the property adjacent to the Eglin Air Force Base continues to be permitted; and (2) except from any conveyances any existing easements for roads and public utilities. Requires the Secretary to require any lands conveyed to Florida that are not being used for educational purposes by ten years after such conveyance to revert to the United States. Requires any lands conveyed to the United States that the Secretary determines are not needed by the Department of Defense to be transferred to the National Park Service for incorporation into the Gulf Islands National Seashore.</summary>
