  <summary>12/22/1987--Introduced.
Natural Gas Consumers Protection Act - Authorizes a State governmental entity or local distribution company to petition the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prohibit an interstate pipeline from transporting gas if such transportation displaces or bypasses the sales or transportation services offered by the petitioning distribution company. Authorizes FERC to grant such a petition even if it has previously certificated such transportation. Directs FERC to grant such a petition if it is demonstrated that the local distribution company is willing to transport such gas: (1) without discriminating on the basis of source, ownership, or destination; and (2) at a cost determined by its State commission.</summary>
