Directs the Administrator, no later than October 1, 1988, to transmit to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees a report prepared by the Academy or other appropriate entity describing the review conducted under this Act and containing a statement of their conclusions as to the human health effects of exposure to agent orange and its compounds.
