  <summary>2/5/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to limit guaranteed and insured loans under such Act to borrowers who: (1) provide electric or telephone service to specified low-density rural areas or will use the loan proceeds for such purposes; and (2) are unable to obtain credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. Authorizes a waiver of such requirements where an applicant is serving a rural area and such services would not otherwise be available.</summary>
