Integrity After Federal Government Employment Act of 1988 - Amends the Federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding former Federal employees attempting to influence the Government. Makes it unlawful, within five years after employment or service has ceased, for: (1) former senior officials to lobby their former employing agency; (2) former top level officials (Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries) to lobby any executive or independent agency or any Member of Congress; and (3) former Members of Congress to lobby any entity of the legislative branch or any top level official of the executive branch. Prohibits any senior or top level official, within five years after employment has ceased, from being employed by, representing, or advising a foreign entity for compensation, financial gain, or other remuneration. Prohibits any person from acting as an agent and communicating on behalf of such former officials and Members of Congress. Includes as exceptions to such prohibitions: (1) any person who is engaging solely in the solicitation or collection of funds and contributions within the United States to be used only for medical assistance, food, or clothing to relieve human suffering; or (2) any person who is providing a statement based on that person's special knowledge, provided that no compensation is received for such statement other than that regularly provided by law for witnesses. Increases the criminal and civil penalties for violations of this Act. Prohibits the partner of a Member, officer, or employee of the legislative branch in a partnership for the provision of professional services from acting as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise representing, any other person other than the United States in lobbying activities in either House of Congress.</summary>
