  <summary>2/19/1987--Introduced.
Nuclear Waste Policy Reform Amendments Act of 1987 - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from implementing nuclear waste disposal activities with respect to more than one repository. Declares that any such activities commenced (or decisions made by the Secretary) before the date of enactment of this Act shall be rescinded or terminated. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from authorizing the construction of more than one repository under such Act. Provides that if the Secretary does not meet the January 31, 1998, deadline for high-level radioactive waste disposal then the Secretary must cease all repository activities until: (1) the Nuclear Waste Repository Review Commission (established by this Act) submits a certain report to the Congress; and (2) the Congress specifically authorizes the continuation of such repository activities (thus imposing a moratorium on repository development). Removes the deadlines by which the Secretary and the President must submit candidate site nominations for second repository site characterizations. Prohibits the Secretary from nominating or recommending any crystalline rock site for site characterization for a repository. Removes the volume limitation placed upon a first repository. Establishes the Nuclear Waste Repository Review Commission (if a repository moratorium takes effect) to: (1) review scientific data regarding repository suitability; and (2) compare the use of repositories for radioactive waste disposal with alternative technologies for the permanent isolation of such waste. Requires the Review Commission to report to the Congress by a certain date regarding its activities and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates such Commission upon submission of its report. Sets deadlines for draft revisions of the Secretary's mission plan under such Act.</summary>
