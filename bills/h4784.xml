Requires that sums necessary for FY 1989 pay raises for programs funded by this Act be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this Act. Requires all grantees receiving Federal funds (including State and local governments) to clearly state, when issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bid solicitations, and other documents describing programs or projects funded in whole or part with Federal money, the dollar amount of such Federal fund and the percentage of the total cost of the program or project which such Federal funds cover. Prohibits a State, effective August 30, 1989, from using any funds available in this Act for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), if it: (1) has not examined the feasibility of implementing certain cost containment procedures for acquiring infant formula and, where practicable, other foods necessary for such program; and (2) has not initiated action to implement any procedures that would lower costs and enable more eligible persons to be served (without interference with the delivery of nutritious foods to recipients). Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to extend the effective date of implementation on a case-by-case basis where necessary. Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971, effective October 1, 1989, to direct the Financial Assistance Corporation to establish a program under which Farm Credit System institutions shall purchase, as debt obligations are issued, stock of the Corporation in amounts determined by a certain formula. Directs the Corporation promptly to rescind purchases of its stock made under certain circumstances and refund the purchase price, deducting and retaining any amount payable with respect to each issuance of debt obligations occurring before October 1, 1988. Directs the Corporation, not later than 15 days before each issuance of debt obligations after September 30, 1988, to notify each System institution of the amount of Corporation stock which that institution is required to purchase.</summary>
