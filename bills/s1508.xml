  <summary>6/10/1988--Senate agreed to House amendment with amendment.
(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Title I: Withdrawal of Groom Mountain Area - Amends the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 to withdraw specified lands in the Groom Mountain area, Lincoln County, Nevada, for use by the Air Force. Title II: Land Transfers - Transfers specified public lands in Nevada to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to become part of the Toiyabe National Forest or the Inyo National Forest. Transfers specified national forest lands in Nevada to the Secretary of the Interior, to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Subjects lands transferred to: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture to the planning requirements of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to the planning requirements of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. Provides for management of the respective transferred lands according to plans currently in effect, or in a manner consistent with other national forest or public lands where no plans are in effect, until such a plan is developed. Directs that any area or portion thereof designated as a Bureau of Land Management Wilderness Study Area, which is made a part of the National Forest System by this Act, shall be managed in accordance with FLPMA to protect its wilderness character until the Congress designates it as wilderness or releases it from further wilderness consideration. Directs the Secretary to recommend to the Congress whether such an area should be included in the National Wilderness Preservation System when he submits wilderness recommendations for other Nevada lands. States that certain roadless areas transferred to such system shall be deemed to have been adequately considered for wilderness for purposes of initial land management plan requirements. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to sell specified lands to Sky Mountain Resort if the Secretary of the Interior does not recommend such lands for wilderness designation. Sets forth other management provisions, including provisions governing the administration of receipts of the Twenty Five Percent Fund, the continuation of existing land use authorizations, and the Federal reservation of water rights. Urges the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior to continue any Experimental Stewardship Programs involving Federal lands transferred under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) transfer title to Wilbur Square to Boulder City, Nevada; (2) enter into an agreement to provide the city lawn and garden equipment in exchange for gardening services on Bureau of Reclamation land within the city; and (3) transfer to the city title to any portion of the city water supply system which remains in Federal ownership and is located outside of the Hoover Dam Security Area.</summary>
