Educational Block Grant for Children at Risk Act of 1988 - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (the Act) to add new chapter 3 provisions for block grants for Innovative Programs for Children at Risk of Low Academic Achievement. (Redesignates the current chapter 3 as chapter 4.) Defines "eligible student," for purposes of such programs, as any child between three and 17 years old who is at risk of low academic achievement and, as a result, may experience future unemployment and welfare dependency. Includes under such term: (1) low-income children, including preschool age children, under chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Act; (2) minority children; (3) pregnant teenagers and teenage parents; (4) dropouts from elementary or secondary school; (5) students with limited English proficiency; (6) students who are substance abusers; (7) homeless children; and (8) neglected and delinquent children. Allows each local educational agency (LEA) to elaborate on such definition. Directs the Secretary of Education (the Secretary) to reserve five percent of chapter 3 appropriations for activities of national significance, including: (1) evaluation of activities for at-risk children; (2) dissemination of information on the effect of programs; (3) research; (4) technical assistance to State educational agencies (SEAs) and LEAs; and (5) rewarding State and local programs. Directs the Secretary to allot to the States from the remainder of such funds: (1) one-third on the basis of the number of school-aged children (between 3 and 17 years old); and (2) two-thirds on the basis of the number of children counted for chapter 1 purposes. Allows a State to reserve up to five percent of its allotment for State administrative costs and up to 20 percent for statewide programs. Directs designated State agencies to allocate a least 75 percent of the State allotment among LEAs on the basis of the factors on which State allotments are based and other specified criteria. Requires LEAs, in order to receive such grants, to enter into cooperative agreements with community-based organizations, business concerns, and other community activities to carry out activities described in their applications. Requires chapter 3 funds to be used for new and innovative programs designed to address the educational needs and other needs of eligible students. Includes among these programs and projects for: (1) improved attendance and educational achievement of eligible students; (2) supplementary education to assist eligible students to attain a grade level proficiency in basic skills; (3) prevention of youth suicide; (4) drug and substance abuse treatment and prevention; (5) coordination of Federal, State, and local efforts serving eligible students; and (6) rewards to schools for lowering dropout rates or reclaiming dropouts. Sets forth requirements for State and local applications. Sets forth criteria for the award of grants. Requires that programs and projects receiving grants: (1) serve eligible students with the greatest need based on the risk of educational failure; (2) are of high quality and likely to achieve chapter 3 goals; (3) address the multiple needs of eligible students; and (4) represent urban and rural regions in the State. Makes certain fiscal requirements and requirements for participation of private school children applicable to chapter 3 programs. Sets forth requirements for local and State evaluations and for program improvement. Provides that nothing in chapter 3 shall be interpreted to preclude the enactment of State legislation providing for the implementation, consistent with such chapter, of the programs assisted under such chapter. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 through 1993 to carry out chapter 3 programs.</summary>
