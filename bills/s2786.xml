  <summary>9/14/1988--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Defense to furnish to any person, upon request, an explanation of all Department of Defense (DOD) requirements, policies, and practices concerning procurement from domestic firms. Requires the Secretary to publicize the availability of such information. Requires each bid submitted by a contractor in connection with a DOD solicitation to: (1) specify the minimum percentage of the total dollar amount of the contract that is to be performed by domestic firms; and (2) include a plan for such performance. Waives the requirement for such plan if the contractor certifies that it is a domestic firm and will perform the entire contract. Specifies that the percentage amount of domestic subcontracting listed in the bid shall be a significant factor in the evaluation of said bid. Requires any contract awarded based on such a bid to require the domestic performance specified. Requires the Inspector General of DOD to investigate a written complaint that a contractor failed to comply with contract requirements. Provides for the imposition of sanctions as determined appropriate by the Inspector General.</summary>
