  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Strategic Numerical Limitations Compliance Act - Prohibits, beginning 90 days after the enactment of this Act, the obligation or expenditure of funds for the deployment or maintenance of weapons systems in excess of the limitations imposed under the SALT II treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. Terminates such limitations upon the receipt by the Congress of written certification from the President that the Soviet Union has exceeded such limitations. Waives such limitations if: (1) the President so requests in writing to the Congress, citing the national security reasons for such waiver; and (2) the Congress authorizes such waiver by bill or joint resolution.</summary>
