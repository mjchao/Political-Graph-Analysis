  <summary>1/21/1987--Introduced.
American Footwear Industry Self-Help Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to estimate and publish annually the number of pairs of nonrubber footwear purchased in the United States (domestic consumption). Limits the percentage of nonrubber footwear that may be imported for such estimated domestic consumption during certain 12-month periods over five years. Directs the Secretary to allocate such import limitations among foreign countries, taking into consideration: (1) average levels of imports for the period 1978 through 1982; (2) findings of unfair trade practices with respect to nonrubber footwear products; (3) recent market trends; and (4) such other considerations as the Secretary deems appropriate. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury to take all necessary actions to enforce this Act. Authorizes the Secretaries to issue such implementing regulations as necessary to effect the purposes of this Act and to enforce its provisions.</summary>
