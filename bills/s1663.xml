Directs the Commission to study and evaluate comprehensively Federal, State, and local public and private resources which affect child and youth deaths. Directs the Commission to make recommendations with respect to: (1) a national policy designed to reduce and prevent child and youth deaths, including more accurate reporting systems and appropriate roles for the Federal Government, States, and local governments and the private sector; (2) changes needed within Federal laws and programs to achieve an effective Federal role in preventing such deaths; and (3) changes needed to improve national data collection with respect to deaths. Directs the Commission, within 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to report to the President and the appropriate congressional committees on information gathered, evaluations, and recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. Terminates the Commission 90 days after the date on which it transmits its report.
