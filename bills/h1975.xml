(Measure passed Senate, amended) Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, to issue such regulations as are necessary to protect significant caves on Federal lands and to provide for the exchange of information between Government authorities and those who use such caves. Directs the Secretary to take such actions as may be necessary to further the purposes of this Act, including: (1) identifying significant caves; (2) restricting the use of such caves; (3) entering into volunteer management agreements with the caving community; and (4) appointing advisory committees. Requires that such caves be considered in subsequent land management plans. Restricts the release of information concerning the location of any Federal cave. Authorizes the Secretary to provide such information upon the written request by Federal and State agencies or bona fide educational and research institutions. Requires such a request to include an assurance to protect the confidentiality of such information. Authorizes the Secretary to issue permits for the collection and removal of Federal cave resources. Subjects the issuance of such permits to terms which may include the posting of bonds to insure compliance with any permit. Requires the Secretary to revoke permits for violations of this Act or permit conditions. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to delegate permit authority to an Indian tribe for caves on Indian lands at a tribe's request. Requires a tribe's permission before the removal of any cave resource on such tribe's land. Entitles a tribe to notice before the issuance of a permit if the Secretary determines that possible harm or destruction of a religious or cultural site may occur. Imposes criminal penalties for the alteration of a cave or interference with cave resources, including the sale or exchange of cave resources removed without permission. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act or permit conditions. Authorizes appropriations. Places permit fees and fines in a special fund in the Treasury for cave management.</summary>
