  <summary>3/15/1988--Introduced.
Condemns the failure of the National Governing Council of Haiti to support a constitutional transition to democracy, to provide security for the Haitian people, and to respect internationally recognized human rights. Declares it to be the policy of the United States to: (1) demonstrate the disapproval of the United States of those elements in Haiti responsible for the failure to restore genuine democratic government in accordance with the Haitian Constitution (approved March 29, 1987); (2) encourage a transition to democracy through the holding of free and fair elections; (3) promote respect for human rights in Haiti; (4) continue to support efforts of the Haitian people to achieve economic development and social justice; (5) deny benefits to the Government of Haiti until there has been a transition to democracy; and (6) recognize that Haiti is a major point for the transshipment of illicit drugs. Suspends the provision of any type of foreign assistance to Haiti. Allows an exception for specified types of assistance, including emergency and humanitarian assistance. Provides that the United States shall use its vote and influence in relevant international financial institutions to oppose any loan or any extension of financial or technical assistance to Haiti, unless such assistance is directed to programs which serve the basic human needs of the citizens of Haiti. Prohibits the extension of certain trade benefits to Haiti, including: (1) treatment as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Caribbean Basic Economic Recovery Act; (2) treatment as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences; and (3) specialized tariff treatment of articles exported to and returned from Haiti. Prohibits the importation from Haiti of any sugars, sirups, or molasses whenever any limitation is otherwise imposed on such importation. Prohibits the selling or leasing of any defense articles or defense services to Haiti under provisions of the Arms Export Control Act. Requires any U.S. Government agency to: (1) take into account the general policy of the United States to deny benefits to Haiti until a transition to democracy has occurred before taking any action with respect to Haiti that is not explicitly addressed by this Act; and (2) report to the Congress any decision to take such action. Requires the President to develop and transmit to the Congress a comprehensive plan for supporting individuals and institutions in Haiti committed to advancing democracy. Specifies the objectives to be considered in developing such a plan. Terminates sanctions imposed by this Act only after the Congress: (1) determines that the Haitian Constitution is being fully adhered to by a Government chosen in free elections; and (2) repeals such sanctions. Allows the President to suspend certain sanctions temporarily if he certifies to the Congress that Haiti is making significant progress toward establishment of a democratic government. Requires the President to periodically report to the Congress on the progress made toward the policy objectives of this Act. Requires the President to submit a report to the Congress which: (1) explains why Haiti has not been treated as a major-drug-transit country for purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Trade Act of 1974; and (2) States whether Haiti cooperated fully with respect to illicit drug trafficking. Repeals existing restrictions on assistance to Haiti as contained in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Act, 1988.</summary>
