  <summary>3/24/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit a taxpayer a nonrefundable 15 percent income tax credit for long-term health insurance costs paid for the benefit of the taxpayer, spouse, or a parent of either. Limits the annual amount of the credit to $300 ($600 if the insurance covers two or more individuals). Reduces the credit percentage as income increases above specified levels ($43,150 single; $71,900 joint). Permits a taxpayer to include as tax-deductible medical expenses any amounts incurred for the long-term health care of a nondependent parent of either the taxpayer or spouse.</summary>
