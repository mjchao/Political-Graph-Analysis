  <summary>3/23/1988--Introduced.
Omnibus Antidrug Abuse Act of 1988 - Title I: Drug Enforcement and Personnel Enhancement - Subtitle A: Asset Forfeiture Fund Amendments Act of 1988 - Department of Justice and Department of Treasury Assets Forfeiture Fund Amendments Act of 1988 - States that expenditures out of the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund and the Customs Forfeiture Fund shall not be scored as outlays which either increase or decrease the Federal budget deficit. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that the Customs Forfeiture Fund shall be available to the U.S. Customs Service permanently. Authorizes the transfer of funds from the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund to the Building and Facilities account of the Federal prison system for the construction of correctional institutions, and to the Support of United States Prisoners in non-Federal Institutions account of the Department of Justice. Allows the Attorney General, with respect to the DOJ Assets Forfeiture Fund, and the Commissioner of Customs, with respect to the Customs Forfeiture Fund, to exempt the procurement of supplies and services under such funds if necessary to maintain the security and confidentiality of related criminal or civil investigations. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to require the Attorney General to ensure the equitable transfer of forfeited property to the appropriate State and local law enforcement agency or prosecutor's office. Subtitle B: State and Local Narcotics Control Assistance Act of 1988 - Part A: Establishment of the Bureau of Justice Assistance - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to: (1) develop an annual State and Local Strategic Drug Control Plan; and (2) publish and disseminate information on the condition and progress of drug control activities. Requires the Bureau to: (1) coordinate Federal, State, and local government efforts toward a national drug control strategy; (2) serve as the coordinating Federal agency with respect to the submission of State and local applications for grant-in-aid programs under the Antidrug Abuse Act of 1986; and (3) maintain a liaison with Federal agencies having drug control authority. Part B: Drug Control Formula Grant Program - Authorizes the Bureau to make grants to States having approved statewide drug control strategies for: (1) Zero Tolerance Enforcement Programs that effect heightened public awareness of and support for local drug control enforcement projects; (2) Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force Programs; (3) Drug Control Law Enforcement Training Programs; (4) Multi-Jurisdictional Intelligence and Data Sharing Programs; (5) Judicial Drug Control Training Programs; (6) Prison Treatment Programs; (7) Drug Treatment for Youthful Offenders Programs; and (8) Statewide and National Intelligence Systems Programs. Requires the executive officer of each participating State to designate a State drug control office to: (1) prepare applications to obtain funds under this Program; and (2) administer such funds. Requires the chief executive officer of each participating State to maintain a State Drug Control Board to: (1) analyze the drug control problems within the State; (2) prepare a statewide drug control strategy; (3) receive, review, and approve (or disapprove) applications from State agencies and units of local governments; (4) prepare annual reports containing assessments of the State drug control program; and (5) assure fund accountability, auditing, and evaluation of programs and projects funded under the Program. Permits the establishment of local drug control offices to prepare and coordinate drug control strategies and implement the provisions of this Act at the local level. States that each jurisdiction which is eligible to have a local drug control office shall establish local drug control boards to: (1) analyze the drug control problem within that jurisdiction; (2) prepare a jurisdiction-wide drug control strategy; (3) receive, review, and approve (or disapprove) applications from units of local government; and (4) prepare annual reports containing assessments of the drug control program. Directs the Bureau to establish a National Drug Control Assistance Coordination Board to provide for the representation of drug control agencies at the Federal, State, and local levels for the purpose of articulating national drug control priorities, programs, and resource needs.
