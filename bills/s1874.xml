  <summary>11/17/1987--Introduced.
Redefines the term "former prisoner of war" for purposes of veterans' benefits provisions to include any person who, while serving in the active military, naval, or air service, was forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during World War II, under circumstances which the Administrator of Veterans Affairs finds to have been comparable to those under which persons have generally been forcibly detained or interned by enemy governments during periods of war.</summary>
