  <summary>3/12/1987--Introduced.
Defense Black Budget Oversight Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense to set forth, in the defense budget for any fiscal year, the total amount requested by the Department of Defense (DOD) for programs of DOD that are included in that budget in a manner designed to conceal their existence or scope. Requires the total amount requested and appropriated for the previous five fiscal years to be included in the first defense budget submitted after the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits the further inclusion in any future defense budget of a program in a way that conceals its existence or scope unless the Secretary, no less than 60 days before the program is included in such budget, provides notice of and justification for such programs to specified members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Provides access to such information by other members of such Committees, and requires the Secretary to respond to any questions or concerns raised by any such Committee member within 30 days after receipt of such question. Directs the Secretary, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to submit to the Congress a report on the criteria used for designating any DOD program as a "special access" program or in any other manner that results in the program being included in subsequent defense budgets in a way that conceals the existence or scope of the program. Requires the Secretary to notify the Congress of any changes in the criteria used for making such designations no later than 30 days before such changes are to take effect.</summary>
