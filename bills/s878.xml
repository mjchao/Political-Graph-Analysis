Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance of 1987 - Title I: Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1987 - Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) to: (1) apportion for FY 1988 specified sums for expenditure on the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, using specified apportionment factors; (2) submit to the Congress at specified dates a revised cost estimate for completing the Interstate System; and (3) use the Federal share of congressionally approved estimates through FY 1993. Sets forth guidelines under which the Secretary is directed to make apportionments if the Congress has not approved cost estimates on October 1, of each of FY 1988 through 1991. Sets forth minimum apportionments for the States for any fiscal year, beginning FY 1988 (including the State of Alaska). Directs the Secretary to apportion for FY 1987 specified sums for expenditure on substitute highway and transit projects, using certain apportionment factors. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1983 through 1991 for highway assistance projects, and sets forth apportionment guidelines for such expenditures. Authorizes appropriations from specified funds provided in the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to liquidate obligations incurred for certain substitute transit projects. Sets forth apportionment guidelines for substitute transit projects for FY 1984 through 1991. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating certain allocations or apportionments to a State unless such State has repaid the Federal funds expended to purchase the right-of-way for any withdrawn portions, or the Secretary has determined that repayment is not required because the right of-way has been applied to the prescribed purposes. Eliminates the deadline for having substitute projects under construction or under contract for construction. Requires the Secretary to include as part of the non-Federal share of the construction cost of a specified highway segment in Washington County, Oregon, all funds expended by private land developers after January 1, 1980, if the State completes construction of such segment. Amends the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to authorize additional appropriations for Interstate construction for FY 1988 through 1993. Sets forth obligation ceilings, with specified exceptions, for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for FY 1987 through 1991/1992 for: (1) the Interstate 4R (rehabilitation) program; (2) the Federal-Aid Primary System; (3) the Federal-Aid Secondary System; (4) the Federal-Aid Urban System; (5) bridge replacement and rehabilitation; (6) hazard elimination projects; (7) Indian reservation roads; (8) forest highways; (9) public lands highways; (10) parkways and park highways; (11) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) highway safety programs; (12) FHWA highway safety research and development; and (13) the elimination of railway-highway crossings on public roads. Authorizes appropriations for the upgrading of certain highways in the vicinity of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (a nuclear waste storage repository in New Mexico). Requires States to expend a minimum of ten percent of Federal-aid highway contracts with small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Prescribes guidelines for a disadvantaged business enterprise program. Amends the Highway Improvement Act of 1982 to extend the authorization for the Federal-aid primary formula from 1986 to 1991. Amends the statutory definition of: (1) construction to include the elimination of roadside obstacles; and (2) "highway safety improvement project" to include the installation or replacement of emergency motorist-aid call boxes. Outlines conditions under which States are permitted to place certain vending machines in safety, rest, and recreation areas. Authorizes the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to construct a State Police Barracks on certain State-owned property. Authorizes the Secretary to waive competitive bidding on a reconstruction contract in an emergency situation. Mandates that procurement of engineering and design services for Federal-aid highway projects conform to the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations establishing and requiring a standardized contract clause in all Federal-aid highway contracts. Permits the use of convict labor and convict-produced materials in highway construction on Federal-aid systems: (1) if such convicts are on parole, probation, or supervised release; or (2) if the materials are produced by convicts in a qualified prison facility, but the amount of materials produced in any 12-month period does not exceed the amount previously produced in such facility during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987. Amends Federal law relating to construction by States in advance of apportionment to authorize the Secretary to pay the Federal share of a State's highway construction costs when a State: (1) has obligated all highway substitute, urban, secondary, or bridge funds apportioned or allocated to it; (2) has used or demonstrated that it will use the obligation authority allocated to it; and (3) proceeds either to construct a highway substitute, urban, secondary, or bridge project without the aid of Federal funds or to construct any project on the Federal-aid primary system, including the Interstate System, without the aid of Federal funds. Limits advance funding for FY 1987 through 1990. Provides that the Federal share of a State's construction costs shall include the interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State only to the extent that the bond proceeds have been expended in the construction of such projects on the Interstate System. (Currently, such Federal share provision applies to any State highway Federal-aid project.) Prohibits the Secretary from approving applications for the Federal share of construction costs if the amount of approved applications in the category of funds involved exceeds certain apportionments for the applicant State. Extends the use of advance construction to metropolitan planning projects, planning and research projects, hazard elimination projects, and projects for the elimination of hazards at railroad-highway projects crossings. Sets forth apportionment and obligation guidelines for Interstate discretionary funds and projects. Revises the priority projects under the Interstate discretionary program. Requires the Secretary to: (1) set aside specified sums for the Interstate discretionary rehabilitation program; and (2) give priority consideration to projects costing more than $10,000,000 on high-volume urban routes or on high truck-volume rural routes. Authorizes the value of unused right-of-way in the State of Arizona to be credited to the unobligated balance of funds apportioned to such State. States that funds made available to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be expended for access and development roads on a Federal-aid system. Revises apportionment guidelines with respect to the Secretary's authority to transfer to the apportionments of a State any amount of funds apportioned for any fiscal year if such amount does not exceed the Federal share of the construction costs of Interstate System segments open to traffic (other than high occupancy vehicle lanes) included in the most recent Interstate system cost estimate. Revises Federal law authorizing the Secretary to approve a project on a toll road pursuant to such apportionment transfers if an agreement has been reached with the affected State highway department (and each public authority with jurisdiction over such toll road) that the road will become free to the public upon the collection of tolls sufficient to liquidate the toll road costs and outstanding bonds (as well as maintenance, operation, and debt service costs during the toll collections period). Authorizes a State, upon certification acceptance, to transfer its excess Interstate rehabilitation apportionments to its Interstate construction apportionments. Declares eligible for 100 percent Federal financing the installation costs of: (1) traffic signs; (2) highway lights; (3) guardrails; and (4) impact attenuators. Declares that the Federal share payable for eligible emergency repairs accomplished within 90 days after the actual occurrence of a disaster shall be 100 percent of such costs. Declares that the Federal share payable for repair or reconstruction of certain park, forest, and Indian reservation roads may amount to 100 percent of such costs. Allows a State to set the Federal match for Federal-aid projects on the Great River Road at a maximum limit of 95 percent and a minimum limit of 75 percent.

Exempts from vehicle weight and length limitations, until September 1, 1988, a motor vehicle having any tank trucks, ocean transport containers, or dump trailers. Revises the penalty for violations of vehicle weight limitations on the Interstate System to provide that withheld funds will not lapse if they are subsequently released and obligated within the four-year availability period. Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program permitting Federal participation in toll facilities in seven specified States. Outlines the parameters of such program. Precludes Federal funding for State facilities which have not been certified biennially by State officials as: (1) being adequately maintained; and (2) having an operator able to fund inadequately maintained facilities without the use of Federal-aid highway funds. Provides for toll agreements covering the West Virginia Turnpike, the Fort Henry Tunnel (Maryland), the Kansas Turnpike, and the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge (New York). Permits the collection of tolls on a certain Florida Interstate highway to be used for: (1) repayment of costs incurred by the State; and (2) liquidation of indebtedness incurred to finance costs associated with a project feature recommended by a certain environmental impact statement. Requires each State to survey railway-highway crossings and set a schedule for installing protective devices where necessary. Allocates certain funds for such devices. Authorizes the preferential employment of Indians on construction projects and contracts on Indian reservation roads. Directs the Secretary to cooperate with both Indian tribal governments and the States to implement such policy. Increases the amounts set aside for the discretionary bridge program through FY 1991. Restricts the obligation of funds under such program to certain highway bridge rehabilitation projects.
