  <summary>3/31/1988--Introduced.
Provides for a counsel-assisted hearing before an administrative judge for certain "Mariel" Cuban detainees (as defined by this Act). Directs the Attorney General to provide such persons with notice of hearing rights and counsel in cases of financial need. Requires the release of a detainee unless the Attorney General establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that such person: (1) is a threat to the community or to other people; or (2) would violate certain conditions of release. States that a release may only be made into suitable community sponsorship or placement. Authorizes the use of Department of Justice funds for half-way housing for such purposes. Provides for stay and revocation of release. Requires annual review of an incarcerated detainee's files. Prohibits judicial review of release determinations under this Act.</summary>
