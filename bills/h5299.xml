  <summary>9/14/1988--Introduced.
Legal Immigration Reform Act of 1988 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise the numerical limitations on total lawful admissions. Sets worldwide immigration levels in three immigrant categories: (1) family-based; (2) employment-based; and (3) independent. Revises the preference system for the allocation of immigrant visas for such categories. Establishes a Select Review Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to review the impact of this Act and report its conclusions to the President and the Congress. Specifies particular considerations to be addressed. Terminates the Commission on the due date of the report, but allows it to function through FY 1992 to wrap up its activities. Provides for transitional levels of visas for spouses and children of legalized aliens through FY 1994 and additional numbers of visas for second preference immigrants through FY 1991. Makes a specific number of immigrant visas available in FY 1990 and 1991 to natives of underrepresented countries. Shortens from five years to three years the usual period of lawful permanent residence required for naturalization. Waives certain naturalization requirements for natives of the Philippines who served honorably in an active-duty status in the armed forces of the United States during World War II.</summary>
