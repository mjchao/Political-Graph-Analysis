  <summary>9/24/1987--Introduced.
Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to commodity credit loans. Provides that when a taxpayer transfers a commodity that serves as collateral for a Commodity Credit Corporation loan, repays the loan with the proceeds of the transfer, and repurchases the commodity with a commodity certificate, the original transfer shall not be considered a taxable event for income tax purposes. Applies retroactively, with a limited exception, to loan redemptions occurring in 1986 and thereafter.</summary>
