  <summary>7/29/1987--Introduced.
Rulemaking Procedures Reform Act of 1987 - Revises the definition of "rule" under the Administrative Procedure Act. Declares that such term does not include agency statements involving a matter relating to public property or contracts or general statements of policy of the Tennessee Valley Authority except where statutorily required. Makes provisions for a Federal agency to promulgate an emergency rule, which shall terminate 120 days after its effective date. Requires agencies, after general notice in the Federal Register, to give interested parties not less than 60 days to participate in any rulemaking, except those for emergency rules. Requires an agency to transmit to the appropriate congressional committees an agenda listing all areas in which the agency intends to propose rules during the next 12-month period. Requires an agency, on the day it forwards a recommended final rule to the Federal Register, to transmit a copy to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives for referral to the appropriate congressional committee. Subjects recommended final rules to the congressional veto procedure. Prohibits major rules from taking effect before 90 days, and nonmajor rules before 45 days, after submission to the Congress. Allows recommended final rules to become effective after the day on which either House of Congress rejects a joint resolution of disapproval. Requires the resubmission to the next Congress of any recommended final rule which is subject to the veto procedure at the time the current Congress adjourns sine die. Allows an agency to issue a recommended final rule which relates to the same acts or practices as a rule which did not become effective. Sets forth general requirements for such an amended rule. Declares that congressional inaction or rejection of a joint resolution of disapproval with respect to a recommended final rule shall not be deemed an expression of approval of such rule. Sets forth procedures for consideration of such joint resolutions of disapproval. Makes it out of order in the House or Senate to vote on final passage of any bill or resolution making appropriations for an agency which has issued a rule that the Congress has disapproved, unless such bill or resolution prohibits the use of appropriations to carry out such rule.</summary>
