  <summary>10/2/1987--Introduced.
Amends Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to the export financing exception to the separate application of the foreign tax credit limitation to financial services income. Permits a taxpayer predominantly engaged in the active business of providing financial services to treat any interest derived from export financing as overall limitation income for foreign tax credit calculation purposes. (Under current law there is a special limitation for financial services income.) Revises the definition of "export financing interest" to include (and thus defer from taxation) interest derived from financing the sale for export of any qualified property manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States. (Current law applies to the same properties, but only if produced by the taxpayer or a related person.) Applies this amendment expressly to Export-Import Bank loans.</summary>
