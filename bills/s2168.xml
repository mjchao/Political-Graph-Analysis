  <summary>3/15/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt from the gasoline excise tax any sale of gasoline to a State or local government (or to a purchaser for resale to such government) for its exclusive use. Prohibits the imposition of excise tax on the sale of diesel fuel to any purchaser (or purchaser for resale to a second purchaser) for any use not as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle or a diesel-powered train. (Although fuel sold for such off-highway uses is generally tax-exempt under current law, provisions of the Revenue Act of 1987 require purchasers to pay the tax and subsequently apply for a refund based on the nontaxable use.)</summary>
