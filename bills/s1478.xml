Incorporates the Great Bear Wilderness Area and the Scapegoat Wilderness Area into the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Provides that the RARE II (second roadless area review and evaluation) final environmental statement (dated January 1979) with respect to national forest system lands in Montana shall not be subject to judicial review. Releases national forest system lands in Montana which were reviewed in the RARE II program from further review by the Department of Agriculture, pending the revision of initial national forest management plans. Releases lands in Montana reviewed in the RARE II programs and not designated as wilderness from management as wilderness areas. Prohibits the Department of Agriculture from conducting any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation of national forest system lands in Montana without express congressional authorization. States that the provisions above shall also apply to national forest system lands in Montana which are less than 5,000 acres in size. Designates the following specified areas to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as part of the National Forest System as specified: (1) the West Pioneers National Recreation Area in the Beaverhead National Forest; (2) the Mount Helena Educational and Recreation Area in the Helena National Forest; (3) the Ross Creek Cedars National Recreation Area in the Kootenai National Forest; and (4) the Gibson Reservoir National Recreation Area in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. Requires that the West Big Hole, Beaverhead National Forest, continue to be managed as a further planning area during the next five years as the Secretary of Agriculture completes and reports to the Congress on a special watershed study. Requires that the Elkhorns National Recreation and Wildlife Area, Helena and Deerlodge National Forests, be managed to conserve recreation and wildlife values. Requires the Secretary to review specified lands in the Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, and Kootenai National Forests for their suitability for preservation as wilderness, reporting to the President and to the Congress within one year. Requires the Secretary to administer specified study areas to preserve their wilderness character for possible inclusion in the system, including the Badger-Two Medicine Wilderness Study Area for the protection of Blackfeet religious and treaty rights. Directs the Secretary to exchange specified lands with the Burlington Northern Railroad Company. Expresses the sense of the Congress that this exchange should be completed within 90 days of enactment. Directs the Secretary to study a potential horse trail in the Swan Range, Flathead National Forest.
