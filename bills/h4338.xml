  <summary>8/5/1988--Reported to House amended.
(Reported to House from the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, amended, H. Rept. 100-747(Pt. III)) Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit any person from dumping sewage sludge into the ocean without having obtained from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a permit imposing a special disposal fee for each dry ton dumped. Requires permittees to: (1) deposit 85 percent of such fees in a trust account for subsequent use on projects to eliminate ocean dumping after 1992; (2) pay 15 percent of such fees to the Administrator for sludge disposal research, reporting, permit, and Coast Guard surveillance and enforcement activities. Authorizes the Administrator to waive the fee requirement for permittees who have entered into a compliance agreement with the Administrator which: (1) is contained in a consent decree entered by the court in the case of the City of New York v. EPA; (2) phases out and terminates ocean dumping of sewage sludge by 1993; and (3) sets forth a schedule for the implementation of an alternate sludge disposal system. Directs the Administrator to report to the Congress within six months of this Act's enactment and annually thereafter on the progress being made toward the development and implementation of environmentally sound alternatives to dumping sewage sludge into the ocean and the cessation of such dumping. Provides that if such report finds that a permittee cannot reasonably cease ocean dumping of sewage sludge by 1993, the congressional committees to which such report was referred shall issue a report within 270 days of such referral regarding action that should be taken to end such dumping. Forbids the ocean dumping of municipal sludge after 1992. Excludes materials and wastes discharged pursuant to specified permits from this Act's requirements. Imposes a civil fine for each dry ton of sludge dumped in violation of this Act's requirements. Prohibits anyone from disposing of sewage sludge at landfills on Staten Island, New York. Authorizes injunctive relief with respect to violations of such prohibition.</summary>
