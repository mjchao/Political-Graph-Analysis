State Energy Conservation Programs Improvement Act of 1988 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to mandate that State energy conservation feasibility reports submitted to the Secretary include a reduction of ten percent in the total amount of energy consumed in such State in the year 2000 from the projected energy consumption for such State in the year 2000. Adds to Federal assistance eligibility prerequisites for proposed State energy conservation plans, including an emergency planning program for energy supply disruption. Repeals the National Energy Extension Service Act. Cites optional State energy conservation programs. Repeals the mandate for supplemental State energy conservation plans. Authorizes appropriations for energy conservation programs for FY 1990 through 1992. Authorizes the use of loan programs and performance contracting for the non-Federal share of energy conservation project costs under the grant program.
