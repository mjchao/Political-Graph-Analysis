Allocates such funds as follows: (1) 60 percent for trade-impacted worker assistance programs; (2) 20 percent for joint labor-management training programs; (3) nine percent for demonstration programs (for FY 1988 and 1989 only); (4) ten percent for State job bank systems (for FY 1988 through 1991 only); and (5) one percent for certain studies under this Act. Reallocates such funds after the limited purposes are completed. Amends title IV (Federally Administered Programs) of the JTPA to add a new part H: Training for Industrial Competitiveness.

Requires an annual report of such study to be submitted to the Congress. Directs the National Commission for Employment Policy to conduct research related to the provisions of this title, including examinations of: (1) the role of the employment services in implementing programs to enhance services provided under this title; and (2) alternative techniques for managing production cutbacks without permanently reducing workforces.
