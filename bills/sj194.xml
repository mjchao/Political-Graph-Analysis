  <summary>10/21/1987--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Expresses certain congressional findings concerning the use of U.S. military forces in the Persian Gulf. Directs the President, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to report to the Congress on the range of U.S. commitments and military involvements in the Persian Gulf region, including the policy of escorting vessels reregistered under the U.S. flag. Directs the Congress, within 30 days after receipt of the President's report, to act on a joint resolution which relates to U.S. policy and commitments of U.S. armed forces in the Persian Gulf region. Provides for the expedited consideration of such resolution in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Expresses the sense of the Senate that it strongly supports and approves the President's actions on October 19, 1987, in response to the Iranian attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters. States that nothing in the resolution shall be construed as limiting the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to utilize American forces in self-defense operations, or as urging the withdrawal of American military forces from the Persian Gulf region. Provides that the report required to be submitted to the Congress within 60 days after enactment of this resolution shall be required to be submitted within 30 days after enactment. States that this resolution in no way affects or complies with any provision of the War Powers Resolution. Provides that nothing in this resolution shall prohibit the U.S. Navy from neutralizing any Iranian vessel, battery, or installation which threatens the safe passage of any American warship or any other vessel known to have American citizens on board.</summary>
