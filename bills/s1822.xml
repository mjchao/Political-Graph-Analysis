(Measure passed House, amended) Sentencing Act of 1987 - Amends the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to make technical amendments with respect to: (1) the application of certain provisions of such Acts; (2) the departure from sentencing guidelines; (3) procedures for appealing a sentence imposed by a magistrate; (4) reviewing sentences for which there are no applicable guidelines; (5) supervised release; (6) determining sentence guidelines for prisoners transferred to the United States; (7) petty offenses; (8) the authority of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate temporary sentencing guidelines; and (9) Commission reporting requirements. Grants the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts authority to contract for psychiatric aftercare. Amends the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to permit persons convicted of certain labor-related offenses to seek relief in Federal court without first attaining Justice Department consent. Eliminates the requirement that the Commission respond to defendant petitions for guideline modifications. States that, with respect to offenses committed before the effective date of the Commission's sentencing guidelines, authority to lower a sentence below a statutory minimum shall be governed by specified provisions of Federal law. Limits the term of imprisonment to be served by persons who violate their conditions of supervised release.</summary>
