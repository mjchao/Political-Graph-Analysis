  <summary>11/30/1987--Introduced.
Title I: Water Resources Authority of the Geological Survey - Geological Survey Water Resources Organic Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Geological Survey, to undertake research, investigations, appraisals, surveys, and related activities of the Nation's water resources. Authorizes the Secretary to cooperate with other government agencies and to perform such activities on a reimbursable basis, as specified. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Title II: Ground Water Research - National Ground Water Research Act of 1987 - Directs the President to coordinate groundwater related activities conducted by Federal agencies. Requires the President to assist States in the conduct of such activities, including disseminating information. Directs the President to establish an Interagency Ground Water Research Committee to coordinate research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, training, and information dissemination activities related to groundwater conducted by the Federal agencies, including establishing priorities. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a report assessing groundwater quality and quantity information systems and data collection and monitoring. Requires the Secretary to submit such report to the Congress with biennial updates. Directs the Secretary to establish and conduct a national groundwater assessment program. Requires such program to assist State and local governments in assessing and managing groundwater resources and designing monitoring programs, including recommending protocols to assist such governments in meeting their data collection responsibilities under specified Federal environmental Acts. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and coordinate a research, development, and demonstration program for the protection and management of groundwater resources, including surveys, the development of cost-effective prevention, detection, and mitigation techniques, and the provision of technical assistance. Sets forth demonstration project selection criteria and procedures, based upon the seriousness of the contaminant addressed and a project's applicability to other locations and circumstances. Requires that such project be monitored and evaluated by the Administrator. Authorizes the Administrator to pay the costs of such evaluation, but limits Federal cost sharing for the project in general. Directs the Administrator to conduct and publish a risk assessment analysis for significant groundwater contaminants according to a standard format and prescribed schedule. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to each establish a technical assistance program to serve other Federal and governmental agencies, including conducting research, surveys, training, and technology transfer. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a National Groundwater Information Clearinghouse. Directs the Administrator to establish a media-specific research committee for groundwater resources. Directs the Science Advisory Board established by the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1978 to review and report to the Congress on EPA's groundwater research programs. Authorizes the Administrator to establish and maintain research fellowships. Directs the Administrator to make grants for groundwater research institutes which are to be located in areas making significant use of groundwater. Requires that funds be equitably distributed throughout the United States and that one of the institutes be the National Center for Ground Water Research, a consortium between Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and Rice Universities. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of costs and earmarks funds for technology transfer. Requires the Administrator to review and evaluate such institutes and subjects the institute's research to peer review. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of the Army to consider the impact on groundwater when evaluating new water resource projects. Authorizes modifications in existing projects to protect groundwater. Requires the Administrator, in cooperation with New Jersey and local governments, to study and report on: (1) the feasibility of removing volatile groundwater contaminants in the New Jersey coastal plain by induced air phase transport; and (2) the problem of trace metal leaching by corrosive groundwater in such coastal plain. Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with California and local agencies, to study and report on the feasibility of groundwater replenishment with treated wastewater and of the potential of groundwater contamination through exfiltration of sewage from sewer systems of publicly owned treatment works. Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with New York State and local governments, to study and report on the pollution of the Buffalo River by contaminated groundwater in Erie County. Directs the Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Army, to conduct a research and demonstration program at the Lake Okeechobee ecosystem, Florida, on the relationship between ground and surface water quality and the management and control of aquatic plants. Requires that methods developed be adaptable to other circumstances and be made available to State and local governments. Requires the solitication of information from other sources such as scientists and management personnel. Requires the Administrator and the Secretary to each report to the Congress on such program and demonstration project, authorizing other Federal agencies to utilize such report. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the President to report annually to the Congress on groundwater generally and groundwater programs conducted pursuant to this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Title III: Agricultural Production and Water Use - Agricultural Ground Water Management Act of 1987 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to investigate and report to the Congress on the relationship between agricultural practices and water use and quality, including current and projected status and efforts. Directs the Secretary to establish an Agricultural Nitrogen Best Management Practices Task Force to report to the Secretary and the Congress on agricultural best management practices, systems, and technologies for reducing or mitigating any negative effects of agricultural nitrogen on water quality. Authorizes appropriations for three fiscal years. Title IV: Ground Water Radium Contamination - Authorizes the Administrator to assist local governments in demonstrating mitigation of radium contamination in groundwater where such groundwater is used as a source of public drinking water in small communities and the contamination exceeds the level established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990 for such program.</summary>
