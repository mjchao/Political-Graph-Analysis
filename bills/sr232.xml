Declares that the Senate deplores the Soviet denial of religious liberty and other human rights in Lithuania and elsewhere. States that, on the occasion of the 600th anniversary of Christianity in Lithuania, the Senate: (1) sends its greetings to the Lithuanian people; (2) voices its support for those Lithuanians who are persecuted for attempting to exercise freedom of religion; (3) urges the President and other officials to speak out against violations of religious liberty everywhere and specifically in Lithuania; and (4) calls upon the Soviet Union to abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights, and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, including the provisions on religious liberty.</summary>
