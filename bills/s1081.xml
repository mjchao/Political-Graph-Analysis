Sets forth the functions of the Secretaries with respect to such program, including: (1) establishing matching grants programs for specified nutritional and dietary purposes; and (2) submitting a biennial report to the President for transmittal to the Congress. Requires the Secretaries to prepare and implement a comprehensive national nutrition monitoring and related research plan which shall: (1) assess and report on U.S. nutritional and dietary trends; (2) sample representative subsets of identifiable low income populations and assess and report on food and household expenditures; (3) sponsor and conduct research; (4) develop and update a national dietary and nutritional status data bank; (5) assist State and local agencies in developing procedures and networks for nutrition monitoring and surveillance; and (6) focus the activities of Federal agencies. Requires the plan to allocate the project functions and activities among the various Federal agencies and offices involved. Provides that the comprehensive plan shall be carried out during the period ending with the close of the ninth fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the final comprehensive plan is submitted. Requires the Secretaries to coordinate and enter into contracts for such scientific research and development as may be necessary to support the coordinated program and comprehensive plan. Requires the President, at the time of the submission of the annual budget to the Congress, to submit a report to specified congressional committees on expenditures required for carrying out the coordinated program and implementing the comprehensive plan. Title II: National Nutrition Monitoring Advisory Council - Establishes a nine-member National Nutrition Monitoring Advisory Council to: (1) provide scientific and technical advice on the development and implementation of all components of the coordinated program and the comprehensive plan; (2) evaluate such program and plan; and (3) submit an annual report to the Secretaries.

Requires the Secretary of HHS to submit, within one year after the enactment of this Act, a report describing the appropriate Federal role in assuring that medical students and physicians practicing in the United States have adequate training in the field of nutrition and its relationship to health. Title IV: Drug-Free Workplace - Prohibits any Federal agency from: (1) obligating or spending any funds under this Act unless it has in place, and administers in good faith, a written policy designed to ensure that all of its work places are free from the illegal use, possession, or distribution of controlled substances by its officers and employees; and (2) making any such funds available unless the recipient of any grant, contract, or other agreement similarly meets such requirements.</summary>
