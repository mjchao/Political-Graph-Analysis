Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 - Makes the legislative history of H.R. 3 applicable to this Act, with specified exceptions. Title I: Trade, Customs, and Tariff Laws - Sets forth congressional findings and purposes with respect to U.S. trade. Subtitle A: United States Trade Agreements - Part 1: Negotiation and Implementation of Trade Agreements - Declares that the overall U.S. negotiating objectives with respect to trade agreements are to obtain: (1) more open and equitable market access; (2) the reduction or elimination of barriers and other trade-distorting pratices; and (3) a more effective system of international trading procedures. Sets forth the principal U.S. trade negotiating objectives with respect to: (1) dispute settlement procedures; (2) improvement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and multilateral trade negotiation agreements; (3) transparency; (4) developing countries; (5) current account surpluses; (6) trade and monetary coordination; (7) agriculture; (8) unfair trade practices; (9) trade in services; (10) intellectual property; (11) foreign direct investment; (12) safeguard measures; (13) specific trade barriers, including the reduction and elimination of tariff and nontariff trade barriers; (14) worker rights; (15) access to high technology; and (16) border taxes. Grants the President the authority, whenever he determines that one or more existing duties or import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States, to: (1) enter, before June 1, 1993, into trade agreements with foreign countries; and (2) proclaim any modification or continuance of duties, continuance of duty-free treatment, or imposition of additional duties, as appropriate. Grants the President the authority to enter, before June 1, 1993, into trade agreements with foreign countries to reduce or eliminate nontariff trade barriers or other distortions or to prohibit or limit the imposition of such barriers or distortions if he determines that they unduly burden or restrict U.S. commerce or adversely affect the U.S. economy, or that the imposition of such barriers or distortions is likely to result in a burden, restriction, or adverse effect. Grants the President the authority, before June 1, 1993, to enter into bilateral trade agreements with foreign countries to eliminate or reduce U.S. duties or trade barriers or distortions to international trade of a foreign country or the United States. Requires the President, before entering into such trade agreements, to consult with specified congressional committees. Sets forth the procedure for entering into such trade agreements. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President, whenever specified actions increase or impose a duty or import restriction, to enter into trade agreements to grant new concessions as compensation to a foreign country that has an existing trade agreement with the United States or to proclaim the modification or continuance of existing duties or duty-free treatment with respect to such agrement if it is necessary to meet U.S. international obligations. Requires the President to determine, before June 1, 1993, whether any major industrial country has failed to make reciprocal trade concessions to the United States under a trade agreement. Requires the President to recommend certain legislation to the Congress with respect to such country if the country has failed to make such concessions. Requires the President to make certain determinations based on specified criteria, regarding state trading enterprises before a foreign country accedes to the GATT. Requires the President, if a country's state trading enterprises meet such criteria, to reserve the right of the United States to withhold extension of such trade agreement between the United States and such country. Provides that, if a country's state trading enterprises meet such criteria, such trade agreement shall not apply between the United States and such country until: (1) such country and the United States enter into an agreement providing that the state trading enterprises will make certain purchases and sales in accordance with commercial considerations and sales; or (2) a bill which approves the extension of such agreement between the United States and such foreign country is enacted. Provides for expedited congressional consideration of such an implementing bill. Part 2: Hearings and Advice Concerning Negotiations - Requires the President, in connection with any proposed trade agreements under this Act, to publish and furnish the ITC with lists of articles which may be considered for modification or continuance of duties, continuance of duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties. Authorizes the President, in connection with non-tariff trade agreements, to publish and furnish the ITC with lists of non-tariff matters which may be considered for modification. Requires the ITC, with respect to each article or non-tariff matter, to advise the President of the probable economic effects of such modifications on: (1) industries producing like or directly competitive articles; and (2) U.S. manufacturing, agriculture, mining, fishing, services, intellectual property, investment, labor, and consumers. Requires the ITC, in order to assist the President with respect to entering into proposed trade agreements and developing U.S. trade policy, to investigate and report to the President as to the effects of modification of any barrier or other distortion to international trade on domestic workers, industries or sectors, purchasers, prices, and quantities of articles in the United States. Sets forth specified actions the ITC must take in preparing advice to the President on trade matters. Requires the President, before entering into certain trade agreements, to: (1) seek information and advice with regard to such an agreement from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Interior, Labor, State, and Treasury and from the United States Trade Representative (USTR); and (2) hold public hearings for comments. Permits the President, when seeking certain trade agreements, to make a formal offer for the modification or continuance of any U.S. duty, import restrictions, barriers or distortions to international trade, the continuance of U.S. duty-free or excise treatment, or the imposition of additional duties, import restrictions, or other barriers to international trade, including trade in services, foreign direct investment, and intellectual property, with respect to any article or matter only after receiving a summary of the public hearings on such actions and advice from the ITC. Directs the President, with respect to offers made in the course of trade negotiations for the modification or continuance of any U.S. duty, import restriction, or barrier to international trade, to take into account any advice or reports submitted by: (1) the ITC; (2) the Advisory Committee For Trade Negotiations; or (3) any organization that holds public hearings with respect to any article, or domestic industry that is sensitive or potentially sensitive to imports. Part 3: Other Trade Agreement and Negotiation Provisions - Repeals the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1982. Amends the Tariff Schedules of the United States to exempt from duty the following items: (1) catalogs of films, recordings, or other visual and auditory material of an educational, scientific, or cultural character; (2) architectural, engineering, industrial, or commercial drawings and plans, whether originals or reproductions; (3) loose illustrations, reproduction proofs or reproduction films used for the production of books; (4) microfilm, microfiches, and similar film media of printed matter issued by literary or scientific institutions, books with the exception of Bibles and prayer books, newspapers, periodicals, tourist and other literature containing geographic, historical, hotel, or similar information, and manuscripts; (5) puzzles, game, sport, gymnastic, athletic or playground equipment; (6) microfilm, microfiches, or similar film media of crossword puzzle books and toy books; and (7) microfilm, microfiches, or similar film media of official Government publications and documents. Provides that no article of developed photographic film may be exempted from duty unless: (1) a Federal agency designated by the President determines that such article is visual or auditory material of an educational, scientific, or cultural character; or (2) such article is imported by, or certified by the importer to be for the use of, any public or private institution or association approved as educational, scientific, or cultural by a Federal agency designated by the President and is certified by the importer to be visual or auditory material of an educational, scientific, or cultural character or to have been produced by the United Nations. Provides that if the President determines that there is or may be profitmaking exhibition or use of developed photographic film which intereferes significantly with domestic production of similar articles he may prescribe regulations imposing restrictions on the entry of that item to insure its use only for nonprofitmaking activities. Provides that the exemption from duty for holograms for laser projection, motion-picture films, sound records and patterns and wall charts will apply only if such items are: (1) imported by, or certified by the importer to be for the use of, educational, scientific, or cultural institutions certified by a Federal agency; and (2) certified by the importer to be of an educational, scientific, or cultural character or to have been produced by the United Nations. Grants duty-free treatment to: (1) holograms for laser projection; (2) motion picture film; (3) sound recordings; (4) patterns and wall charts; (5) tools specially designed to be used for the maintenance, checking, gauging, or repair of scientific instruments; and (6) articles specially designed or adapted for the use or benefit of the blind or other physically or mentally handicapped person. Removes toy models from the exemption from duty. Authorizes the President to restrict the duty-free treatment accorded to tools for scientific instruments or apparatus or articles for the blind and for other handicapped persons if the duty-free treatment has significant adverse impact on a domestic industry manufacturing or producing a like or directly competitive article and the effect of such change is consistent with the provisions of the relevant annexes of the Florence Agreement or the Nairobi Protocol. Provides that if the President proclaims changes to the Tariff Schedules of the United States to limit duty-free treatments the rate of duty thereafter applicable shall be the rate determined by the President as the rate which would then be applicable to such article from such source if the duty-free treatment had not been enacted. Allows the President to resume duty-free treatment if he determines it could be restored without significant adverse impact on a domestic industry or portion thereof. Requires the President, before limiting or resuming duty-free treatment, to afford an opportunity for interested Government agencies and private persons to present their views concerning the proposed action. Authorizes the President to remove or modify any condition or restriction imposed for visual or auditory material to implement the Nairobi Protocol. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce to obtain statistical information with respect to printed matter. Implements changes in the tariff treatment of the following products, pursuant to the United States-European Communities Agreement on Citrus and Pasta: (1) anchovies; (2) certain cheeses; (3) satsuma oranges (mandarin); (4) olives; (5) capers; (6) paprika; (7) cider; and (8) olive oil. Authorizes the President to modify or terminate such changes at any time. Amends the International Coffee Agreement Act of 1980 to extend the effective period of such Act until October 1, 1989. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to initiate bilateral currency negotiations with a foreign country on an expedited basis whenever, in the course of trade negotiations, the President is advised by the Secretary that such foreign country satisfies specified criteria for initiating bilateral currency negotiations. Requires the President to update each report on wine exports that the President submitted to specified congressional committees pursuant to the Wine Equity and Export Expansion Act of 1984. Requires each updated report to contain: (1) a description of the tariff or nontariff barriers to trade in U.S. wine of each major wine trading country with respect to which the USTR has carried out consultations; (2) the status of such consultations; and (3) other information based on developments since the submission of the President's report on wine exports. Subtitle B: Implementation of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule - Declares that the Congress approves the U.S. accession to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Requires the President to submit a copy of each final instrument of the Convention to the Congress. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the President to make such modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule as are necessary to conform the old Tariff Schedules to the format of the Convention. Requires the ITC periodically to review and recommend modifications to the President with respect to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Permits the President to proclaim such modifications if he determines that they: (1) conform to U.S. obligations under the Convention; and (2) do not run counter to U.S. economic interests. Requires the ITC to publish the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to compile U.S. import and export trade statistics. Makes the USTR responsible for coordinating U.S. trade policy with respect to the Convention. Sets forth provisions with respect to U.S. participation in the Customs Cooperation Council. Provides for conversion to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include digital processing units for automatic data processing machines among the products subject to the President's authority to modify their tariff treatment with respect to the enforcement of trade agreements with foreign countries. Subtitle C: Response to Unfair International Trade Practices - Part I: Enforcement of United States Rights Under Trade Agreements and Response to Certain Foreign Trade Practices - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the USTR, subject to the direction of the President, to take specified action to enforce U.S. trade rights under an agreement or to eliminate unfair trade practices if the USTR determines that: (1) the rights of the United States under any agreement are being denied; or (2) a foreign act, policy, or practice violates or otherwise denies U.S. benefits under any agreement, or burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. Sets forth circumstances under which the USTR is not required to take such action. Requires the USTR to take appropriate action to eliminate any foreign act, policy, or practice whenever he determines: (1) that such act, policy, or practice is unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce; and (2) that action by the United States is appropriate. Permits any interested person to file a petition with the USTR requesting action to enforce U.S. trade rights under an agreement or eliminate unfair trade practices. Requires the USTR to initiate an investigation with regard to such petition if an affirmative determination is made. Requires the USTR to consult with the foreign country concerned regarding the issues involved in such investigation. Requires the USTR, based on his investigation and the consultations, to: (1) determine whether U.S. trade rights are being denied under any agreement, or any unfair trade act, policy, or practice exists; and (2) determine what action to take if an affirmative determination is made. Sets forth a timetable for such determinations. Requires the USTR to implement action to eliminate such unfair trade practices or enforce U.S. trade rights within 30 days after such determination is made. Requires the USTR, if he makes an affirmative determination involving export targeting by a foreign country and determines not to take action with respect to such affirmative determination, to: (1) establish an advisory panel to recommend measures to promote the competitiveness of the domestic industry affected by the export targeting; (2) on the basis of a specified panel report, take administrative actions or propose legislation that would restore international competitiveness of the affected domestic industry; and (3) submit to the Congress a report on such actions and legislative proposals. Requires the USTR to monitor each measure undertaken or each agreement entered into by a foreign country to: (1) enforce U.S. trade rights under the agreement; or (2) eliminate any unfair trade practice. Provides for modification or termination of actions to enforce U.S. trade rights or eliminate unfair trade practices. Requires the USTR to make available to any person upon request information concerning: (1) trade practices of a foreign country with respect to goods, services, investment, or intellectual property rights; (2) U.S. trade rights under any agreement and the remedies available under such agreement; and (3) past and present domestic and international proceedings with respect to such practices. Requires the USTR to identify U.S. trade liberalization priorities, including major trade barriers and trade distorting practices which, if eliminated, would have the most potential to increase U.S. exports. Requires the USTR to initiate an investigation with respect to all priority practices identified by the USTR for each of the priority foreign countries. Requires the USTR to identify: (1) those foreign countries that deny adequate protection of intellectual property rights or deny fair market access to U.S. persons that rely upon intellectual property protection; and (2) those foreign countries that have been determined by the USTR to be priority foreign countries. Requires the national trade estimate prepared annually by the USTR to include a list of the trade barriers of each foreign country and an estimate of the value of additional U.S. goods and services and the value of additional foreign direct investment by U.S. persons that would have been exported to, or invested in, each foreign country if each of such trade barriers did not exist. Requires the USTR to consider the value of such U.S. exports and investments in determining the trade distorting impact of such trade barriers. Changes the date on which such annual report (to be known as the National Trade Estimate) is due to April 30, 1989, and on or before March 31 of each succeeding calendar year. Requires the USTR to initiate an investigation with respect to Japanese practices that are barriers to the offering or performance by U.S. persons of architectural, engineering, construction, and consulting services in Japan. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should propose to the Japanese Prime Minister that a summit be held between the leaders of the United States and Japan to: (1) address trade and economic issues; and (2) establish an agreement that provides objectives for improvement in trade and economic relations, including targets for achieving such objectives. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the USTR and other U.S. officials should: (1) give highest priority to concluding and enforcing agreements with Japan which achieve improved market access for U.S. manufacturers of supercomputers and end predatory pricing activities of Japanese companies in the United States, Japan, and other countries; and (2) continue to monitor the efforts of U.S. manufacturers of supercomputers to gain access to Japanese markets while recognizing that Japan may continue to manipulate the government procurement process to maintain the market dominance of Japanese manufacturers. Part 2: Improvement in the Enforcement of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the administering authority, with respect to antidumping duty cases, to determine whether a foreign subsidy has been provided to a specific foreign enterprise or industry. Requires a finding that subsidies exist with respect to the manufacture, production, or exportation of certain agricultural products processed from raw agricultural products. Permits the USTR to revoke the status of a foreign country as a country under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures if such foreign country: (1) announces that it does not intend, or is not able, to honor its obligations with respect to the United States or the Agreement; or (2) does not in fact honor such obligations. Requires the administering authority, with respect to countervailing duty investigations, to cumulate all subsidies provided to members of any international consortium in determining any countervailing duty upon merchandise that is manufactured by such consortium. Requires the administering authority, if the merchandise involved in a dumping investigation is exported from a nonmarket economy country and it is not possible to accurately determine the foreign market value of such merchandise from the information submitted by such country, to determine the foreign market value on the basis of the trade-weighted average price at which comparable merchandise is sold by a specified eligible market economy country. Provides for determining such foreign market value when there is inadequate information for making such determination. Defines "nonmarket economy country" to mean any country that the administering authority determines does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures. Requires the Commissioner of Customs and the ITC to provide the administering authority, upon request, with a copy of all public and proprietary information that they possess that is relevant to dumping proceedings involving merchandise from nonmarket economy countries. Authorizes the administering authority to suspend an antidumping investigation involving a nonmarket economy country if specified conditions are met. Allows a domestic industry that produces a product that is like or directly competitive with merchandise produced by a foreign country to petition the USTR for antidumping action if such industry has reason to believe that: (1) such merchandise is being dumped in an Agreement country (Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-relating to antidumping measures); and (2) such industry is being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of such dumping. Sets forth provisions relating to input dumping. Allows the administering authority to consider the occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of merchandise subject to an antidumping duty order are sold after the issuance of such order in the foreign country markets from which such merchandise is exported as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the merchandise if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the foreign market value of such merchandise exceeds the U.S. price of the merchandise. Authorizes any domestic producer of an article that is like a "component part" or a "downstream product" to petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring. Defines "component part" to mean an import that: (1) during the five years preceding the petition has been subject to a countervailing or antidumping duty order or agreement; and (2) is used routinely as a major part in other manufactured articles. Defines "downstream product" to mean any import into which is incorporated any component part. Requires the administering authority, within 14 days of receiving the petition, to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion of such component parts. Sets forth factors to be considered in making such determination. Requires the administering authority to notify the ITC if such determination is affirmative. Requires the ITC to monitor, and report on, the levels of trade in downstream products. Requires the administering authority to: (1) consider the reports in determining whether to initiate an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation on any downstream product; and (2) request the ITC to stop monitoring such product if the reports indicate that imports are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversionary dumping of component parts. Authorizes the administering authority, under specified circumstances, to include within an antidumping or countervailing duty order imported parts or components of certain merchandise assembled in the United States or in other foreign countries. Provides that any steel product manufactured in a country that is not party to a bilateral arrangement (a non-arrangement country) from steel melted and poured in a country that is an arrangement country will be treated for purposes of the quantitative restrictions under that arrangement as if it were a product of an arrangement country. Allows an eligible domestic entity to file a petition with the ITC requesting that a product category be established for short life cycle merchandise that becomes the subject of two or more affirmative dumping determinations. Defines "short life cycle merchandise" to mean any product that the ITC determines is likely to become outmoded within four years. Permits the administering authority, if it finds a reasonable basis to suspect that an alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement after the initiation of a countervailing or antidumping duty investigation, to request the Commissioner of Customs to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the class or kind of merchandise that is the subject of such investigation. Requires the Commissioner to collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of such merchandise and to transmit such information to the administering authority upon request until: (1) a final determination is made with respect to such investigation; (2) such investigation is terminated; or (3) the administering authority withdraws its request for such information. Requires the ITC, if there is an affirmative determination of a subsidy or dumping, and critical circumstances and material injury to an industry exist, to determine whether retroactive imposition of a countervailing or antidumping duty on the merchandise is necessary to prevent recurrence of material injury that was caused by massive imports of such merchandise over a short period of time. Adds to the conditions permitting a foreign exporter to post a bond in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties in antidumping duty cases: (1) the antidumping duty investigation has not been designated as extraordinarily complicated; (2) the final determination by the administering authority has not been postponed; (3) the person who was sold dumped products provides credible evidence that the amount by which the foreign market value of such products exceeds the U.S. price for such products is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the administering authority's antidumping duty order; and (4) the foreign market value and U.S. price data apply to sales in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison by the administering authority. Requires the administering authority, before determining whether to permit the posting of such bond in lieu of the deposit of estimated duties, to: (1) make available all proprietary information supplied to it under protective order to all interested parties; and (2) afford all such parties an opportunity to file comments with respect to the posting of such bond. Provides that certain producers of raw agricultural products may be considered part of the industry producing processed agricultural products for purposes of bringing countervailing and antidumping duty complaints. Sets forth the criteria such producers must meet. Defines "material injury" for purposes of complaints involving imports of a raw agricultural product and products processed from such raw agricultural product. Classifies a coalition or trade association which represents either processors, processors and producers, or processors and growers as interested parties in such investigations. Sets forth specified factors to be considered by the administering authority in determining whether a lease is equivalent to a sale for purposes of antidumping or countervailing investigations. Allows the ITC, in making a determination of material injury in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to consider other economic factors that are relevant to the determination of such injury. Requires the ITC to explain its analysis and the relevance of each factor considered in making its determination. Adds to the factors that the ITC must consider in examining the impact of imports on a domestic industry the actual and potential negative effects on existing efforts of such industry to develop and produce a type of product derived or developed from an earlier type of product. Requires the ITC to evaluate all relevant economic factors within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to such industry. Adds to the factors that the ITC must consider in determining whether the threat of material injury exists: (1) the actual and potential negative effects on existing efforts of a domestic industry to develop and produce a type of product derived or developed from an earlier type of product; and (2) in dumping cases, dumping findings in other countries against the same exporter. Requires the ITC in such dumping cases to request information from the foreign exporter or U.S. importer on threat of material injury. Requires the ITC, in determining whether material injury occurred in an antidumping or countervailing duty case, to assess cumulatively the volume and effect of imports from two or more countries of like products if such imports compete with each other and with like products of the domestic industry in the U.S. market and if such imports: (1) are subject to any countervailing or antidumping duty; or (2) during the preceding 12 months were subjected to a final order, suspension agreement, or quantitative restraint resulting from such an investigation. Requires persons making submissions to the administering authority or the ITC in antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings to certify that such submissions are accurate and complete to the best of that person's knowledge. Provides that the administering authority and the ITC shall require that business information for which proprietary treatment is requested in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation be accompanied by a statement that such information is of a type that should not be released under an administrative protective order. Requires the administering authority to establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations made with respect to antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. Prohibits antidumping and countervailing duties from being treated as regular customs duties for drawback purposes. Subjects merchandise imported by, or for the use of, a U.S. agency to the imposition of countervailing or antidumping duties. Sets forth specified exceptions. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to undertake a study regarding the new market orientation of the People's Republic of China. Part 3: Protection of Intellectual Property Rights - Amends the Tariff Act of of 1930 to make unlawful (and therefore subject to remedies for unfair trade practices) the importation or sale within the United States, if a related industry exists in the United States or is being established, of articles that: (1) infringe a U.S. patent or copyright or are produced by a process covered by a U.S. patent; or (2) infringe a trademark. Makes it unlawful to import a semiconductor chip product in a manner that constitutes infringement of a registered mask work. Sets forth the manner of determining whether a U.S. industry exists. Authorizes the ITC to terminate an investigation into unfair practices in the import trade by issuing a consent order or on the basis of a settlement agreement. Authorizes a complainant to petition the ITC to issue an order for the exclusion of certain articles during an investigation into unfair practices in the import trade. Sets forth the timetable for action by the ITC. Authorizes the ITC to grant preliminary relief with respect to violations involving intellectual property. Provides that the ITC may issue cease and desist orders in addition to or in lieu of exclusionary orders. Increases the penalty for violations of such orders. Requires the ITC to presume the facts alleged in the complaint are true and to issue, upon request, an exclusion from entry or a cease and desist order or both under certain circumstances. Authorizes the ITC to prescribe sanctions for abuse of discovery and abuse of process. Authorizes the ITC to order the forfeiture of an article imported in violation of the import trade unfair practices section if: (1) the importer had previously attempted to import the article; (2) the article was previously denied entry into the United States; and (3) upon such previous denial of entry the Secretary of the Treasury had provided the importer with a specified written notice. Provides that a person who has been previously found to be in violation of the provisions relating to unfair import practices may petition the ITC for a finding that such person is no longer in violation of such provisions or for a modification or rescission of an exclusion. Excludes intellectual property imported by or for the United States from certain exclusion orders. Provides for the protection of the confidentiality of information submitted to the ITC or exchanged among the parties in cases involving unfair import practices. Part 4: Telecommunications Trade - Telecommunications Trade Act of 1988 - Directs the USTR to conduct an investigation to identify priority foreign countries that maintain barriers to U.S. telecommunications products. Requires the USTR within 30 days after such investigation is completed to report on it to the President and appropriate congressional committees. Directs the President to negotiate with such countries for the purpose of entering into an agreement which meets specific negotiating objectives. Sets forth such objectives. Directs the President, if unable to enter into such an agreement, to take whatever actions are necessary to achieve such objectives. Directs the President to take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the country concerned, unless it is determined that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving the negotiating objectives. Sets forth the actions the President may take in such circumstances. Requires the USTR to review annually the effectiveness of: (1) each trade agreement negotiated by the President; and (2) every other trade agreement regarding telecommunications products or services that is in force with respect to the United States. Requires the USTR, with respect to such review, to determine whether a foreign country that has entered into an agreement: (1) is not in compliance with such agreement; or (2) denies to telecommunications products and services of U.S. firms mutually advantageous market opportunities in that country. Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements with a foreign country to grant concessions as compensation in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions if: (1) the President has taken action because no trade agreement could be reached under this Act; and (2) such action is found to be inconsistent with U.S. international obligations, including the GATT. Requires the President to seek advice from a specified interagency trade organization before taking any action against a foreign country under this Act. Directs the USTR to keep the Congress informed of: (1) the negotiating priorities and objectives for each country involved; (2) the assessment of negotiating prospects; and (3) any U.S. concessions which might be included in negotiations to achieve such objectives. Authorizes the importation of a product that is subject to registration or approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) only if: (1) such product conforms with all applicable FCC regulations; and (2) the information which is required on a specified FCC form is provided to the appropriate customs officer at the time of entry into the United States. Directs the FCC, the Secretary of Commerce, and the USTR to provide enforcement assistance to the Secretary of the Treasury upon request. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide the Congress with information on such imports. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study the competitiveness of the U.S. telecommunications industry and the effects of foreign telecommunications policies on it in order to assist the Congress and the President in determining what actions might be necessary to preserve such competitiveness. Subtitle D: Adjustment to Import Competition - Part 1: Positive Adjustment by Industries Injured by Imports - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President to take appropriate action to help an affected industry (if it produces an article like or directly competitive with an imported article) make a positive adjustment to import competition if the ITC determines that an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause (or threat) of serious injury to such industry. Authorizes an entity, including a trade association, firm, union, or group of workers, to file a petition with the ITC requesting action to facilitate positive adjustment to such import competition. Permits a petitioner to submit to the ITC and the USTR a plan to facilitate positive adjustment to such competition. Requires the ITC (upon the filing of a petition, the request of the President or the USTR, the resolution of either the House Committee on Ways and Means or the Senate Committee on Finance, or on its own motion) to investigate whether an article is being imported in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause (or threat) of serious injury to such industry.
