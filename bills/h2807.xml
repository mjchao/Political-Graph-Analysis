Amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to make grants to any coastal State to implement a coastal erosion and flood control assistance program if the Secretary: (1) finds that the coastal State imposes a 30-year erosion setback; (2) finds that the State has or is making progress in developing a management program approved under specified provisions of such Coastal Zone Act; and (3) approves the coastal erosion and flood control program of the State under this Act. Authorizes a coastal State to apply to the Secretary for approval of its coastal erosion and flood control assistance program. Specifies requirements for a program and circumstances in which the Secretary may suspend approval of a program. Establishes the Coastal Erosion and Flood Control Assistance Fund for making grants under provisions of this Act and administration of such provisions. Sets forth reporting requirements.</summary>
