Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the operating stability of certain documented fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Makes exceptions to specified safety provisions in this Act for certain fish processing vessels. Prohibits operation of a vessel in violation of this Act or in the absence of emergency assignments and periodic emergency drills in compliance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Provides for termination of unsafe operations of fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Empowers the Secretary to exempt a vessel from the requirements of this Act.

Sets crew requirements regarding safety training and safety training certification for fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels. Requires operators of such vessels to be licensed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Requires regulations prescribed by the Secretary regarding casualty reports to be uniform for all vessels engaged in commercial service. Requires the Secretary to: (1) compile statistics concerning marine casualties from insurers of fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels; and (2) prescribe regulations to gather a statistical base for analyzing vessel risks.
