Directs the Secretary, no later than November 1 of each year, to provide to specified members of the defense committees notice of and justification for such special access programs. Outlines information to be included in such notice and provides access to such information by other members of the committees. Requires the Secretary to respond to any questions or concerns raised by any such committee member within 30 days. Directs the Secretary to notify the defense committees of any changes in the criteria used for making special access program designations no later than 30 days before such changes are to take effect. Requires the total amount requested and appropriated for the previous five fiscal years for such special access programs to be included in the first report to the committees required under this Act. Directs the Secretary, no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, to submit to the defense committees a report on the criteria used for designating a program of the Department of Defense as a special access program.</summary>
