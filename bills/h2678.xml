Amends the Higher Education Act to establish a loan repayment program with respect to guaranteed student loans and direct loans. Directs the Secretary of Education to make 100 percent of the payments due on such loans on behalf of any full-time teacher in a public elementary or secondary school who began such teaching within 18 months of graduation from an institution of higher education. Continues this repayment program for as long as the teacher remains employed by a public elementary or secondary school.</summary>
