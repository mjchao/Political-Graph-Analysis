  <summary>12/21/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase from $45,000,000 to $60,000,000 the amount permissible in the Boat Safety Account in the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund without triggering a prohibition of transfers into the Account from the Highway Trust Fund for FY 1988 and thereafter. Extends from April 1, 1989, to October 1, 1999, the date before which expenditures may be made from the Boat Safety Account for recreational boating safety programs. Grants the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating liquidating contract authority with respect to State recreational boating safety programs in an amount equal to one-half (currently two-thirds) of the amount of motorboat fuel taxes transferred to the Boat Safety Account in FY 1988 and thereafter. Increases from one-third to one-half the portion of such funds available for Coast Guard services in connection with recreational boating safety services. Prohibits fiscal year expenditures for Coast Guard expenses from exceeding those for State boating safety programs generally. Amends Federal law to permit a State to use contributions of funds, materials, and services to carry out certain fish restoration and management projects in lieu of paying its share of the activity.</summary>
