  <summary>10/14/1988--Introduced.
Trademark Protection Act of 1988 - Amends the Lanham Trademark Act to prohibit the importation or sale within the United States of goods manufactured outside the United States and bearing a trademark that is identical to a trademark owned by a U.S. citizen, corporation, or other entity and registered under U.S. trademark laws unless such owner consents to the importation for sale. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to exclude such goods from entry into the United States upon the request of a U.S. trademark owner who has filed a trademark registered certificate with the Secretary. Authorizes the trademark owner to bring an action against importers in any Federal district court to enjoin such importation and to obtain money damages and lost profits for the wrongful use of a trademark. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to enforce this Act.</summary>
