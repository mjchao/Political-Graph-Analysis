  <summary>1/6/1987--Introduced.
Exclusionary Rule Limitation Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that evidence obtained by a search or seizure shall not be excluded in a Federal proceeding if the search or seizure was undertaken in an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. States that evidence obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant constitutes prima facie evidence of such a reasonable belief (unless the warrant was obtained through intentional and material misrepresentation). States that, except as provided by statute or a rule of procedure, evidence which is otherwise admissible shall not be excluded on the ground that the evidence was obtained in violation of a law, rule, or regulation.</summary>
