  <summary>5/18/1988--Passed Senate amended.
(Measure passed Senate, amended) Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criminal penalties for: (1) intentionally defacing, damaging, or destroying (or attempting to deface, damage, or destroy) any religious real property because of the religious character of that property (provided the loss from such defacement, damage, or destruction exceeds $10,000); or (2) intentionally obstructing (or attempting to obstruct) any person's free exercise of religious beliefs. Precludes any prosecution under this Act unless the Attorney General provides written notice that, in his judgment, prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure justice.</summary>
