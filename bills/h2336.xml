  <summary>5/8/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to establish statutory guidelines for the regulation of duty-free sales enterprises. Authorizes such enterprises to sell and deliver for export from the customs territory of the United States duty-free merchandise in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Sets forth restrictions on the location, deliveries, and operations of such an enterprise, including requirements that such an enterprise: (1) provide reasonable assurances that merchandise sold will be exported; (2) limit the merchandise sold to any individual to quantities appropriate for personal use; and (3) post notice that merchandise is subject to Federal duty and tax if brought back into the United States. Provides that this Act does not prohibit a duty-free sales enterprise from offering for sale and delivering to individuals departing from the customs territory merchandise other than duty-free merchandise. Declares that merchandise purchased in a duty-free sales enterprise is not exempt from duty under the Tariff Schedules of the United States if such merchandise is brought back to the customs territory. Requires the establishment of a separate class of bonded warehouses for duty-free sales enterprises.</summary>
