  <summary>8/4/1987--Introduced.
Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to prohibit all employee benefit plans (not just pension plans, as at present) from merging or consolidating or transferring their assets or liabilities unless each plan participant receives benefits after such transfer which are either equal to or greater than the benefits received before such transfer. Applies this Act to mergers and transfers occurring on or after April 12, 1984.</summary>
