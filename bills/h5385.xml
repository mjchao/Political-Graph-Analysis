  <summary>9/26/1988--Introduced.
Amends the Federal judicial code to prohibit States from: (1) imposing a higher tax assessment ratio upon telecommunications service property than is imposed upon other commercial and industrial property; (2) collecting an ad valorem property tax on telecommunications service property at a tax rate that exceeds the rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction; and (3) imposing any other tax that discriminates against a telecommunications common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. Grants Federal district courts concurrent jurisdiction (without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties) to enjoin, suspend, restrain, or set aside such discriminatory tax treatment. Permits relief only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of telecommunications service property exceeds by at least five percent that of other commercial and industrial property in the taxing jurisdiction. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any savings accrued by reason of the enactment of this Act should be passed on to consumers.</summary>
