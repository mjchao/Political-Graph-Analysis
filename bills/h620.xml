  <summary>1/20/1987--Introduced.
Elderly Earnings Opportunity Act of 1987 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to make uniform for all beneficiaries: (1) the amount of outside income which beneficiaries may earn without incurring a reduction in benefits; and (2) the percentage of nonexempt earnings which are deducted from benefits as excess earnings. Adds $1,000, until the year 2000, to the annual outside income which a beneficiary may earn without incurring a benefit reduction. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct an ongoing study to determine whether further modifications of the treatment of a beneficiary's outside income are necessary or appropriate. Sets forth reporting requirements.</summary>
