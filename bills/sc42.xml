  <summary>4/7/1987--Introduced.
Declares that the Congress: (1) condemns the violations of human rights engaged in by the Castro Government in Cuba; (2) urges all appropriate international bodies to pressure that government to live up to internationally accepted human rights standards; (3) welcomes the fact that 18 members of the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted to put the question of Cuban human rights performance on the Commission's agenda; (4) regrets that the Commission, by a one vote margin, decided not to put the issue on its agenda; and (5) regrets that the democracies of the Western Hemisphere failed to vote unanimously to put the question on the agenda.</summary>
