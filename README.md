# Political-Graph-Analysis
You probably hope that politicians vote according to their party ideals. We will provide supporting evidence for that. Perhaps you also wonder if corporations pay politicans to hold specific views? This is a trickier problem because there's little quantitative evidence. For our EECS 598 (Mining Data from Large-Scale Graphs) project, we build and explore a graph involving corporations, politicians, and bills in US Congress.

One of our most interesting results is that we show a machine learning algorithm can learn the Democrat-Republican split in US Congress solely from the companies that have donated to each legislator and the amounts. The algorithm's performance improves after *Citizens United v. FEC*. We also show, as expected, that voting records expose the Democrat-Republican split. So now, we're left with an observation that corporate donations are about as good of an indicator of political ideals as voting records.

The liberal says, "Let's ban ice cream because it causes drowning."

The ice cream CEO says, "Let's drown some kids to boost ice cream sales!"
